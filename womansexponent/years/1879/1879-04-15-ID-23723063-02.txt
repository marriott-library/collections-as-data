"Home sweet h6me, there is no place like home," Is often said and sung by peo. pie who never care to beat home, and in. deed are ever ready to escape from home and when at home are always looking for' ward to the happy time when they shall escape from the dreary, humdrum place. In truth these people have no home; they have a dwelling, but a dwelling is not the exact synonym of a home. Architects can build you a dwelling and put in it every possible convenience make it, as the arch, itects say, replete with conveniences, but no architect can make a home of it. Neither Michel Angelo nor Palladio could do that. Architects can build you a house, 'but to make it a home is beyond their power. And yet the thing is not difficult to do. Day laborers can do it. Not far from where I live there is a palatial residence. It stands In a magnificent park studded with ancient trees. Dappled deer and tall antlered stags roam about in the park. I have never boen in the house, but I am told by one who has by the gardener, In factthat all that art can achieve has been done to make it a perfect residence, and yet, as my friend told me, it is rarely occupied by the family. In the London season, if not abroad, they live in Belgrave Square; As soon as the season is over they are off to the Continent Paris, Naples or Rome. In tho winter my Lord, and perhaps my Lady (there aro no children, come down, my Lord to hunt and shoot; but they seldom stop there more than a month or so; my Lady never more than two or three weeks, as she " doesn't like, the place." "Well" he replied, "they never seem to mo to have what I should call a home. They are never often together,,and my Lord has his friends, and my Lady hers. At least so I am told, but we know but very little hero about their London life. All I have to do with them Is to send twice or three times a week fruit and flowers to tho butler. Come he said, and see my homo." 'With all my heart," said I, and im. mediately we crossed the park and entered a pretty double cottage, which I saw at onco was a 'home." The room was spotlessly clean, as was everything in it. sill of the quarried window was a row of brilliant flowers. Through the open door which led into the garden the sweet voices of young children came to my ears. Presthe buxom matron came to greet me, ently and asked me to take refreshments.
