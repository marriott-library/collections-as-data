'm'? 12th ward S. L. City, Jan. : MfY A Wolf who had got a Bone stuck sh his throat ran up and down in the greatest ' agony, entreating every animal he met to relieve him. A Crane moved by his entreaties, and pitying his sufferings, ventured his long neck down the Wolfs throat and drew out the Bone. Bui although the Wolf thus owed his life to the Crane, he would not confess It, but went about saying that after all Cranes were but silly creatures; that "they would rush . Into danger foolishly, and that it was much to his credjt that he had not bitten off this one's, head when she had put herself so much in his power. , Moral. Many a man who has owed his life to a woman's devotion has thought this no reason why he should not speak contemptuously of the whole sex. I , Another truth, which is but faintly wore- alized by our civilization, and which fitted to emphasize, man is the fact that only moral purity is able to perceive the divinity of things. To see the gods, we must become their peers. LITTLE HOME. My littlo homo! I look around and days and honrs of happiness: arise before me. I recall the hours when my dearly beloved husband sat and talked with mo, or smiled upon our cniiaren, or sang nymns wiin us all. Hours that come not again, save in .remembrance, the smile has faded from his face and the song of "Sweet rest has been realized; blessed hours o the past! TJiey live forever in the memory like the fragrance of a crushed flower. Those hours Will never be forgotton, and the memory of them is often evoked by some slight a hslo of happiness comes with it. .But then again arises the memory of hours of sorrow, at other times, hours of bitterness of spirit j when death had invaded the household, andjife seemed a blank, save for .the comfort of my children. Gloomy hours, sorrowful hours; but thank God, time has taken the keen edge from those deep griefs, and I can look back upon them now without sorrowing.-- .
