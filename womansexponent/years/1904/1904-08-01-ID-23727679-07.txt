NATIONAL COUNCIL WOMEN STATES. UNITED My dear In pursuance of the plan inaugurated in my letter of April 22nd, I write to indicate the way in which it seems to me best to arrange the postponed annual demonstration on behalf of Peace and Arbitration, which in the usual order would have been set for May 16th, but on account of the Thirteenth International Congress of Peace, which is to convene in Boston the first week in October, was deferred. The plans for the congress are now so fully made that we may go forward with our own. The congress in Boston will open on Monday, October 3d, but will be preceded by a great demonstration on Sunday, October 2nd. The pastors of the leading Boston churches of all denominations have agreed to devote the morning service of that day to the Peace cause. In the afternoon there will be a large special meeting at Tremout Temple. It seems, therefore, eminently proper that the Peace and Arbitration Committee of the National Council of Women of the United States thall ask the clergy throughout the country to devote the morning service of Sunday, October 2nd, to some phase of the subject of peace and arbitration. The meeting in Boston will occupy the entire week. I feel that we can get the benefit of the enthusiasm which this Thirteenth International Congress may excite, as reports of it shall be disseminated by the press throughout the country; and I therefore recommend that our committee shall, through its various subordinate branches, endeavor to have the demonstration arranged for Saturday, October 8th. I feel that our general plan should coincide with that of previous demonstrations. First. Let a member of each local committee seek to address the "clergymen's meeting," anc thus get a personal opportunity to ask ministerial associations to take action in regard to this use of Sunday, October 2nd; or let each local committee send out to all of the clergymen of your community a circular letter making the The fact that the great same request. are going forward at Boston on meetings that date will inevitably secure the favor of clergymen who otherwise might be uninterested, and will add zest to local meetings. Second. Let each local committee organize a press committee, and make it the duty of the committee on press to see that adequate notices are given of the approaching Peace Congress in Boston and of the approaching peace demonstration; of Mr. Edwin D. Meade, the chairman of the committee on organization of the congress, and of Mr. Benjamin F. Trueblood, the secretary, both of whom may be addressed, 20 Beacon Street, Boston, Mass. Lists of foreign speakers, preliminary announcements, programs, etc., may be obtained, which if you can have reproduced either in whole or in part in your local papers will help turn the attention of the' community to the subject. Third. I take the liberty of giving below pertinent subjects for discussion at the demonstration: 1. The pecuniary cost of war. 2. The moral results of war. 3. The effect of war upon the national ideal of American citizenship.
