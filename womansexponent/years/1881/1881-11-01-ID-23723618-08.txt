WOMAN'S EXPONENT. 88 Influence, like trne lovcr comes unasked, and following in its wake may be found all that is so vainly sought and so ar dently desired, by those "who resort to petty cxr&dients o devces for a little eclat. I The man of influence h one whose whole life him in all ho says and all he does. If supports ru uo i. ,i . it: i a ining, it.no Bays nu win toe- iniswry oi man's life passes through the minds of his nearers, and every lormer act comes to the front: and declares in- - words of cold, that he will do what he says. He has proven himself to be a man oi truth and oi honesty, and all who know him know that his word is as cood as his lite, lie has wen their confidence. I do not calo how ignorant that man is; I do not care how bad may be the people among whom he lives, that man must have influence. It is as sure to follow an upright course, as disease, is to follow a violation of the laws of nature;' and I do not care how polished a man may be, how intelligent, how educated, how eloquent, if he is not honest, if he is not truthful, he can wield no personal influence. He may talk with the tongue of an angel, he may tell the truths of a God and peoplewill believe them because they are true but they come with ho force from the lips of the liar, or the politician, or the hypocrite. ' While the man of honesty tells his simple truths, and they are treasured, because his hearers know he would not tell them what he docs, unless he firmly believed what he says. ia a mistaken idea. and-trifl- - inc 1 Honesty and truth, morality and the virtues ate the foundation for influence, and unless you observe these cardinal principles, you may as well strive to get the moon as to obtain a permanent influence. Do not be misled. You must be t.r ha influential; and after a few years of honesty una irmniuiness, you will find your power increase as you are intelligent; and the longer you follow such a course greater will become your power, for every act of your lives will back you up in what you say. That is the way, and the only way to obtain influence. Simple Simon. MISCELLANEOUS. visit to John G. Whither, at hishome in Ex. .

The MSS. of "Little Dorrit" and "Martin Chuzzlewit," which are to be seen at the South Kensington Museum are models of penmanship. Thackeray always wrote a hand which seemed in keeping with the delicate fancy and artistic finish of his work. But there are exceptions, and if any one wants to know how villianously a great man can scrawl his ideas, he should look at the handwriting of Carlyle. -- X 33 OFFICE: - STn OPPOSITE SILT DO Xt 041.
