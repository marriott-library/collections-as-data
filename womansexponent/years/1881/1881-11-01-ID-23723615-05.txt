Please read it carefully, and then act accordingly. Home Industry. Among the skillful exhibitions of the Ladies' Department, one could but admire a selection of fancy hair work. People collection of always surrounded the tasteful, Brother Alfred Andre, a Frenchman, recently from Paris, who had exhibited about 120 different samples of this kind of work, which seemed to be of great interest to the numerous visitors of the Fair. Several young ladies had exhibited some very pretty fancy hair work, but Brother Andre's was something quite new, and deserved the first prize, Diploma, which has been awarded him. Here is the beginning of a more elaborate home industry in this direction. Mothers having buried children may perhaps be gratified to bracelet?, have the darling's hair as watch-guardor necklaces, preserve breastpins, the precious locks in hair pictures, or as memorials, etc. Ladies wishing to acquire a knowledge of this work can obtain the requisite information to enable them to make the work themselves, or can have anything in this line manufactured, by applying to Prof. A.

She subsequently filled the office of teacher in the Society, which she honorably held during the remainder of her life. She was a faithful Latter-da- y Saint, and died in hopes of a glorious resurrection. Sister Cooper was much beloved by all who knew her. She is an heir of glory and exaltation; her good deeds will live, though she has passed away from our sight. Well may it be said of her, "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord." Susannah Lloyd.

Editor Exponent: I J. had the pleasure of visit from you, I should not have to explain "the wherefor and why" that my little article, " TheCity of the Saints," remains unfinished in the Exponent ; for verily 'tis a favorite subject with me, and shall yet receive a finale, D. V. I never ask pardon of my friends for being somewhat egotistical, as it always appears to cast a doubt upon their affection for me; judging them from myself, I come to this conclusion : my friends' joys and sorrows, health and sickness, and, indeed, all their affairs I am interested in, and when they p3ak of themselves my heart, brain, eyes and ears compose a loving audience, and I feel they payne a . compliment. After this prelude I will say, for the last three months I have0 experienced an entire prostration, mentally and physically, of vital God strength, and nothing but the Spirit' ofmuch and my own will kept me from giving up that I felt was my imperative duty to do; so I have been nursing myself, waiting and hoping. I have let my mind, my heart and my brain does oc'lav fallow' as the wise husbandman calls for casionally portions of his land that the neither allowed plow, such repose; I have to over roll the nor them, pass nor the harrow, into thrown be to them; seed they have nor been open to the pure air of heayen, it3 rain, and dew, and sunshine; the thunder and the the lightning have rolled over them, and made state thi3 atmosphere pure and healthy. In Will they have lain in a glorious inertia! with they again rise up invigorated forth health, fruit? and strength and vigor, and bring Dear Friend Had very passivaabout it; I look at my pen : Thou dear little siren, how thou hast blest me I e'en from my childhood's days thy little plume has wafted me in golden visions, been the portrayer of my soul, in which I have seen myself as in a mirror ! By thine aid I have held sweet communion with the pure and good, the intelligent, the kind, the loving, the true and faithful, even unto death ! As I write, the desire comes back to wield again this little weapon, which, in the hands of the magnates of the ages, has been, and is, and will be far mightier than the sword! How this little instrument has blest me I and many tell me I have blest them by it. And then I yearn to still have the power to "bless myself m blessing others. These thoughts cause my eyes to naturally turn upward, and their silent language to the Great Physician is touch my heart and brain with a coal from off thine eternal altar, where burns the fire of Eternal Love ! Arouse the dormant spirit; as a harp is struck by the hand of the master and responds, to his touch, give me power to strike chords that shall vibrate in the hearts of all my readers. I desire not that ephemeral thing called fame, I was not organized for it; I desire but to live in the hearts of my brethren and sisters in time and all eternity. Your last issue, of the Exponent pleased me much. The article on "good reading" should be reduced to practice by all. "Simple Simon" is surely a, wise man! How truthful his words and comprehension of matters that have come under the ban of prohibition, simply because the subject has not been investigated with an unprejudiced mind. Surely we, as Saints that have suffered, and daily suffer from this sort of judgment and verdict without the Court, should suspend our judgment until we can say positively, this is good, and that is evil. But surely the names alone of Scott, Bulwer, Dickens (whoso weird and pathetic pictures of the poor of Ltondon cnlled forth. OH Act of Parliament for ameliorating their condition), George Elliot, Elizabeth Browning, and a host of others, will establish the fact, that a community will be enlightened and benefitted by the perusal of such works. But I am writing a letter, not an article. I see you have two new contributors that is good; tell them to ever take Excekior for their motto, My best wishes are for you and our unique little paper; may we soon see an enlarged edition, which many are looking for. and may I be enabled to cast my mite into the treasury of mental wealth of the Exponent, is the desire of your correspondent, and soliloquise Hannah T. Salt Lake City, Oct. 23, 1881. King. LETTER FROM LULA. Salt Lake Dear Aunt Em: Iwant City, Oct. 20, 1881. ( to give you a brief account of a short bnt very interesting visit which I lately made to Spanish Fork, in company with my husband's mother, Mrs. Sarah G. Richards. It was known that we contemplated vising that place, to see our dear old friend, Sister Gwynn Morgan Lewis, now in her eighty-thir- d year; wo were therefore solicited to be there on Monday, October 17, and attend a joint annual meeting of the Relief Society and Primary Association. We were pleased to comply, and accordingly took the two o'clock Southern train Sunday afternoon. The little three and a half hour ride was a'very enjoyable one to ne. Passing the "Point Of the Mountain, and looking westward at the pond3 and springs, and what I could see t)f Porter Rockwell's old place, many recollections and reflections passed through my mind.
