The arbitrary manner in which this congress has been summoned can do nothing to retard the continually improving status of women doctors. It is probably the last occasion on which they will be excluded, and it will be remembered as a stupid protest against the advancing toleration and liberality of the age, the expiring effort of bigotry and EnglUhw.omans Review high-hande- d trades-unionis- PON E N T .

It is strange that of all posssble tasks, simply to be what we are should prove not the easiest, but infinitely the hardest. One of the most effectual ways of pleasing and of making oneself loved is to be cheerful; joy softens more hearts than tears. Faith, like light, should ever be simple and unbending; while love, like warmth, should beam forth on every side and bend to every necessity. Our custom and habits are like the ruts in roads; the wheels of life settle into them, and we jog along through the mire because it is too much trouble to get out of it. Depend upon it, in the midst of all the science about the world and its ways, and all the ignorance of God and His greatness, the man or woman who can say, "Thy will be done," with the true heart of giving up, is nearer the secret of things than the geologist and tkeolo-gisGeorge M acdonald. t. Encouragement. Whenever you can con- scientiously encourage any one, do so. You would not leave those plants in your window-boxe- s without water or refuse to open the shutters that the sunlight might fall upon them; but you leave some human tiower to suffer from want of appreciation or the sunlight of are a few hardy souls that can struggle on stony soil shrubs that can wait for tne dew and the sunbeams, vines that will climb without kindly training but only a few. Utter the kind word when you can; give the helping praise when you see that it is deseryed. The thought, that "no one cares and no one knows," blights many a bud of promise. Whether it be the young artist at his easel, the workman at his bench, the boy at his mathematical problems, or the little girl at her piano, give what nraise you can, for many a one has fallen by the way for the want of that word of encouragement which would have "stablished their feet." encour-agement.The- .A.. 23 re IB. irSPFl?
