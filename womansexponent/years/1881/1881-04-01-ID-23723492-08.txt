E XP WOMAN'S 168 counsel was wise, and she had resolved to abide duties by. it. She would settle her mind to the before her and say to Howard she would not and go. Minnie was a staunch little 3torinon, willingly gave u(- all the fine prospects they - had. jl'atteml her with. Iler childish faith had never been shaken with dogmas nor sectarianism. To 'her God was Omnipotent, and conJoseph Smith wai hie prophet. She had belier fidence in Brighaiu Young and faith to his counsel was for the best. Thu was a great comfort to Mary and gars her itrengtn in those hour of darkness, for it is hard to go against the feelings of those that are dear to U3, even though it accords with our best judgment. To be continued. THORVALDSEN. The great sculptor Thorvaldsen was born at the Copenhagen in 1770. His mother was wood-carver, daughter of a peasant; his father was a for vessels. who made rough figure-head- s When Albert,orBerteI,as his people called him, was old enough, he went into hi father's workshop, and after a little practice it wjw seen that his work equalled ,and in some point .excelled, his father's. Hi father saw that if properly educated, Bertel might be an artist; and at eleven years old,he was put in to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. He cared for no kind of study excepting that of his art, which he was passionately fond of. His teacher thought him quite a dunce; and when on the distribution of prizes at the Fine Art Academy, a young Thorvaldsen got the silver medal, he said it might be a relative of Bertel's, and thought to hold him up to the boys as an example of industry. What was his astonishment on finding 1hat Hel hinfterfT-'A'ftinh- at 'Mr- - teacher called him "Herr," which was a great honor. In 179G Thorvaldsen embarked for Naples,and then went to Home. The Danish Academy supported him there six years, and at the end of that time he prepared to return to Denmark. As there was trouble about getting his passport be was delayed, and while waiting, a wealthy gentleman entered his studio, and seeing the statue "Jason," he was so charmed with it that he ordered it in marble. An agreement was made, and Thorvaldsen remained in Roine. After that he was more prosperous. Napoleon ordered "Alexander the Great entering Babylon" in marble, but by the time it was finished, Napoleon was an exile. Poland ordered two statues; but being delayed by sickness they were not finished till after the fall of Poland. Nevertheless, he found sale for them. During this time the "Jason" was sadly neglected, and it was twenty years before the gentleman received it! Thorvaldsenjreturned to Copenhagen on a visit; but he had but little peace, as his rooms were constantly crowded with visitors.' Again he went to Copenhagen. He was received with all the pomp and glory that could le devised by both king and vassal; and even his native sky welcomed him home, a there was a gorgeous aurora borealU at night. On landing he was drawn in a carriage by the people instead of by horses, although he was ignorant of the fact until he arrived at the palace. The people refused to be satisfied until they liad all seen their countryman, and so Thorvaldsen appeared on the balcony and bowed to the assemblage. So highly did they honor him that it is said there vrus "danger of his being killed with kindness." Thorvaldsen moved in all classes f society. His shoemaker was hi frknd, as was ul- - the King of Bavaria; Lord Bvr-- . u, and Sir Walter Scott were among his friends. He died in 1844. His coffin was arried by forty artists, and on it waj lying a wreath of flower wovwi by the Quc. Oa - 0 N ENT the day he died, he was working on a bust of Martin Luther. Among his many beautiful statues are "Night," "Morning," the "Nest of Lovers," and the Lion of Lucerne." M. Emma Kent. CLASS IN MIDWIFERY. BOUMWNIA B.

ELLIS The women of Nebraska may well rejoice to have secured the advance step in the equal Suffrage movement having succeded in securing the passage of the bill to remove the word 'male" from the Constitution. We had fondly hiiped that Utah might have had that honor, and but for the veto of the Govenor who, seems to hold almost sovereign power in this Territory, Utah might have been the first. It was not for the lack of effort or championship on the part of men or women, and the constti-uent- s of those members who voted favorably on that bill remember them gratefully and they also remember the others, otherwise.
