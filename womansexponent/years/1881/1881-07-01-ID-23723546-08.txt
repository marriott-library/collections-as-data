24 WOMAN'S EXPONENT. , ferenee of the Y. L. M. LA. of Weber Stake, Mrs. Sarah A. Herri ck presiding. The same brethren and sisters occupied the stand as on ths previous day, except a few young lady presidents and Dr. Ellen B. Ferguson, of Salt Lake City. The spirit of i lie meetings in both forenoon and afternoon sessions was elevating and the instruction was highly edifying. The speakers were Prest. S. A,. Ilerrick and her counselors, Emily S. Richards and Josephine J w West. Several young lady presidents of various wards and settlements spoke iuielligentlv upon the principles of the Gospel, proving how beneficial for spiritual improvement had been the training they had received in thec-- Associa-- e tions. Sisters Eliza R. Snow Smith, E. B. Wells and E. B. Ferguson, M.D., each addressed the As we have not space for all, congregation. we give below an extract from the speech of the last named: The speaker appealed earnestly and eloquently to the young, urging them to appreciate the blessings they enjoyed in the Gospel, and not listen to the allurements of those in the world who seek to lead them aside from the path of duty; urged them to beware of the liberty which they so fascinatingly portrayed. She had lived in the outside world and could speak experimentally ot both the conditions of society. If we go back to our Father with our gouls dwarfed, uncultivated and undeveloped, we will be clipped of the glory it is our privilege otherwise to enjoy in eternity. Spoke upon, the care of the physical organization of the body, how necessary it was in order to do the work of life; she referred to the evil tendency of late hours, round dancing, tight shoes and other things which destroy the health; alluded to the misrepresentations of ministers in their conference abroad, and appealed to the young ladies who kept Gentile company to know what their fate would be in the morning of the resurrection. She thought woman's greatest mission was to bear the souls of men, and tho practices which existed in the world tended to destroy offspring, women continually trying to avoid the condition of motherhood. The speaker gave some of her experience in the outside world previous to embracing the Gospel, and said that the pleasures of the world, though fair to all appearance, had, like the apples of Sodom, turned to ashes on her lips and were bitter afterwards. She entreated the young ladies to live their religion, considering well the terrible consequences of going astray, of forfeiting their birthright. Sister E. R. Snow Smith addressed the meeting, expressing her joy in being with the sisters here in Ogden again, after so long an absence. She felt greatly attached to them, and she observed a material growth among the young sisters in these organizations, mental and spiritual; she realized it forcibly here referred to the first Association of young ladies which she had the honor of effecting by direction of the Holy Priesthood; these young The parents had sisters are respected now. come to realize the benefit of these meetings by the result. The heart must be cultivated as well as the head; our spirits must be matured as well as our bodies; she had sometimes thought there were those who called themselves Saints who thought they might enter the Kingdom of God withont doing this. Inasmuch as we direct our time and attention to ,the things of this world, and neglect our spiritual welfare, we will lose by it. What is tlni wealth of the world compared to the knowledge that God has spoken and the intelligence that has been revealed from heaven? Urged the sisters to continue reading the Bible 'and Book of Mormon and Doctrine and Covenants; they will show you how gtrict the Lord was with His Mrvants; exhorted the young ladies to read to-da- y; carefully the revelation given to Emma Smith, and notice at the close of this revelation that what wa3 said unto her was said unto all. It gave her advice in regard to her duty to her husband; in order to carry out this in our lives,we need great cultivation. You will obtain this by applying your minds to reading the scriptures and cultivating yourselves in these meetings by the aid of the Spirit of God. Sister Eliza also made allusion to tho evils which were entering in among our children, ..and the necessity of taking care of the little ones and preserving their bodies and souls pure; spoke upon the Gospel and how we should obtain a perfect knowledge of it; signs follow the believers and are not given to convince unbelievers. The Savior said, "In my name they shall cast out devil3." We have precisely the same Gospel Jesus and His disciples taught. We are philosophers enough to believe the same causes produce the same effects; referred to the various sects professing to have the authority; out it they had, it must have come from the mother church. We have our authority from another source, direct from heaven.' Our religion covers everything in heaven and upon the earth. The Lord has given us perfect principles, but it will require the practice of these as well as the profession. In conclusion she related a conversation with a lady from Boston, who thought the railroads wonld make great changes in our religion. Sister Eliza answered, "O, no, the principles of our religion are eternal there can be no change." Conference was adjourned for three months. The report of the Primary Conference in Og- den is crowded out of this issue, but will appear on our next number. It that at the signing of "The Treaty of Berlin," in 1878, there were "ten men" present representing their different nations and courts, the Earl of being the "head and front" of the whole affair.
