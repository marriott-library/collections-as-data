WOMAN'S EXPONENT 104 justify any teacher or leader in placing the tempting cup to the lips of youth and declaring it noble and sublime? No! Nor would it Saint in giving his time justify any Latter-da- y and attention to the production of spirituous liquors, no matter how great his abilities for producing excellent articles might be. There is better employment, nobler aims for tlua. Latter-da- y Baints than the production, study, or use of novels or whiskey. Shakespeare, I believe, lived and wrote according to the best light he had in his day; and other great authors may have done the same. But in our day, let us thank God that eater light has come into the world, and that Sis people are called to a higher calling than the production or study of fiction. Let lis praise and bless Him that He has given us precious, tangible, eternal truths to study and reflect upon, and to talk and write about. I am aware that occasionally a page or a paragraph of a novel contains some excellent moral lesson, or embodies some beautiful sentiment. But we can always find lessons on the same subjects, and even more exalted sentiments, more briefly and yet more clearly stated in the written word of God. The best writers of fiction invariably turn to the Scriptures for their best and wisest arguments. ?Then is it not wisdom in us to search the Scriptures for ourselves, and find them in their own beauty and strength, rather than take another's rendition of them, mixed up with a great deal of adulterating material ? I say it is. One of the commandments of the Lord to His Saints is, "Treasure up in your minds continually the words of life." Surely "the words of life" Life Real, Life Eternal, are not to be found in any d work, or in anything whatever, save in Truth Real, Truth Eternal! man-create- Lula. tion than any other reform.

The complete success of the cause is only a question of t ime. E vexv, intelligent observer sees thus; and there are many indications that its advocates will not have long to wait.
