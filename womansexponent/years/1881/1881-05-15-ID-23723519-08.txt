Vejlr Editor Exponent: paper withinterest, and I read your yaluable finds an echo in heart; my many, an article is our often how and I often think, path made and sorrow re of through thisworld pleasant by an exchange of ideas,, a kindly word dropped here, a smile there, and a little to please others. A I muse this evening, my mind reflects How vividly I back just two years call to mind the kindness of my brothers and isters, which I hope I may never forget ! and with your permission I will relate it may bring comfort to some of my sisters who are liable to pass through like circumstances, and make them feel they are "surrounded by kind friends. Two years ago my husband was called to gp on a mission to Germany. The time for his departure was drawing nigh. One day, while busily engaged in preparations for his journey, my thoughts and hands busy, at times I would feel sad, and my aching heart would seem to say, Oh, can J shoulder this responsibility be both a father and mother to my little ones? But it was but for a moment; my thoughts would ascend to my Heavenly Father, asking Him to aid and assist me, and thanking Him that we were counted worthy to help just a little in the noble work. And in the ups and dcsxss q llfupast Jtw& years, Jhave found Him a true friend and comforter. But I am forget- - ' ting my story. I was just ironing the last shirt, when a brother stepped in and invited us to supper at six o'clock punctually at his house. I cheerfully accepted. At the appointed time we were ready. My husband and I sat talking a few minutes about his near departure, when one of the children called out, "Oh, ma, the band is coming to our house." Imagine our, surprise, as we stepped to the door, to see some of the Stake Presidency, our Bishop and Counselors, headed,; by the Martial Band. Without ceremony we were told to follow, so on .we went, the band playing. As we drew near .the meeting house, on one side of the street stood members of the Relief Society, and on the other the Y. L. M. I. A., who greeted, us. Still we passed on, not knowing where we were going, until we entered the meeting house, where were two lpng tables filled with the bounties of life, and surrounded by our' brothers and sisters. They seated us, and after the blessing was asked told us to partake; but I was too full to eat. After supper we spent the, evening in dancing, recitations, singing anid speeches, and I have never experienced such a spirit of good feeling as was there maiiifested, nor will I ever forget the kindness shown us there; and in the past two years it has often comforted me, for I felt I was among iriends, and they have since proven themselves such. do the world know of the true Oh, how-JHt-le happiness of wiring the living God, and trying to live our most holy, religion ! God grant when my, husband returns our labors may be accepted, and we will still go hand in hand rejoicing in the great and grand work of the last Anna. . , days, -- self-sacrifici-ng to-da- y. it--pe- rhaps . . - , " laving Links " and " Life Incidents," will be conducted-ithe next issue. n " ITieWild Flowers of Dcseret" will short It be issued Srom the Juvenile Inztmdar Office, 4 f Dear Aunt Desires the Ladles of Salt Lake and those visltfag the City, to call at bor 8 bow Booms and see her New Stock of MILLINERY. : The latest and most stylish molM of Hai a.nA nw nets, In Straws, Felt and Velvet Also, a nice selection in Flowers, Feathers, Flushes, Velvet and Ribbons in the latest shades and stripes.

Good Work Guaranteed I Em: been reading an excellent paper on the Higher Education of Vomeri, which, held mortals to reach so high an ideal for us I have poor in order to be truly intellectual, that I am almost tempted to say, I will write no more. What few little watfi I have written shrink out of sight in the broad blaze of fiich genius as is possessed by Mesdames De Stael, Eliot and Sands. My tiny buds of thought wither and look unspeakably mean. But listenReason speaks. Who read the giants of literature? The cultivated few. Who read the daily, weekly, monthly papers? The thoughtless masses, of whom I am one. Shall I not sit in the gates and point the way to the fair temples above, because I cannot reach my weak hands up to grasp the ponderous key? Must I sit sullenly down and refuse to hold a helping hand to aid the climber who, down, still farther down than I, but feebly walks among the ; rubbish and debris? Because, forsooth, I may not ever reach the lofty top and hear the glorious music peal from crag to crag, nor smell the freshnesa of the flowers divine, may I pot upward fyo'wt the way to one, who, catching the refrain, is fired to struggle on and cling to that strong, mental staff, an aim in life? No; I'll be myself an earnest worker, and with voice and pen will seek to waken fruitful thought in heedless youth to elevate myself, and through the force of my example, linked with searching words, portray to those around me the beauty of a studious life. t Saloame.

Most of the brethren, as well as some of the sisters, made some short, pithy speeches, complimentary to Sister Lewis. Spoke of her kind heart and the great good she had done in her position as President of the teachers, and in laboring among the sick. Sister Lewis showed her appreciation of the surprise in a few humble remarks. We spent a very pleasant evening, and retired to our homes mutually benefitted. Slioes, art SdiclUA. ZTJMtio 25.
