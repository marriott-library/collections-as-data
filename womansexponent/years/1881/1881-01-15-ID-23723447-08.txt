Although God had told King Hezekiah he should die, upyet through his prayers He had compassion life. for entreaties his to listened and him on So we see God hearkens to prayer and is moved by it. We are told He is the same yesand forever; and if He listened terday, to Hezekiah, He will hearken to our prayers, if we walk before Him in truth and righteousto-d- ay ness. Through supplication to the. Almighty the dead have been raised, the clouds withheld their rain for the space of three years, armies were destroyed, and Samson was avenged upon the Philistines, when he was brought before them for sport.

If those good men required the prayers of the Saints, I think it is requisite and right for us to pray and I for the Apostles and Saints of feel sure they need our prayers and that they would like us to pray for them. These words ofttimes pass through ray mind: "The prayer of a righteous man availeth much." Then I, for one, would solicit the prayers of all good men and women. And I pray God that I may so live that my prayers for them will also prevail with God and avail them much. -- to-da- y; live our I will just add that we are trying to work we religion and help roll on the mighty are engaged in.
