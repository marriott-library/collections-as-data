It was remarked that the organization of these Associations were designed to d throw a around the young to preserve them from the evil influences and vices of the age; and to this end it needed the cooperation of mothers, and that the officers should be efficient women and versatile in their selections of subjects, so the children might be full of interest.

Editor Exponent: annual meeting of the Primary Association of Samaria wa.s held Friday evening May 0, 1881, in the house a largo and well filled meeting audience several of the Priesthood of the Ward being present; the evening's entertainment consisted of a song by ten little girls entitled "Jesu3 once of luimlta birth" j raver by Bishop Evans, singing by the child rt i; "Work for the night is coming," mritatioiis, dialogues, were then spoken. Five little girls were then catechised and son- - wore sung. Essay on Obedience, one song by a hoy and some little girls between three and rive years of age, one recitation a boy four years of age. We then had a song from ten little girls entitled "God speed the right." My thoughts went back to the time of the organization and I could see then that we had made a ) lit tie progress since; it is true it seems slow work with the little ones while laboring with them, but I feel thankful to the Lord for his Holy Spirit; that enables us to persevere in this great and important work, having faith and praying to the Lord for strength to load and guide us all; realizing that the time will come when these associations will stand forth a great and mighty host battling for truth, and they petition to God for blessings on those that organized them and placed them in a position where they could be taught in the laws of their Heavenly 'Father while they were that as young ihey grow in years they may be from unhide influences and from preserved wolves in sheep's clothing who seek to draw the young from the fold, and to bring destruction upon the people of God. Oh, mothers I would say, assist your children in th'.-iorganizations encourage them to attend their meetings, and ..also attend them yourelvdo not think it toa much trouble they will repay you in the future; becoming bright and shining lights crowned with immortality and eternal lives; may our Heavenly Father bless all that strive to teach the young And rising generation is the prayer of your Mre.
