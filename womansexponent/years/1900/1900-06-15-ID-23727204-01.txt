The last place visited on Tuesday moni-- i ing was old St. Peter's Church, where Washington used to attend service. There-armany uld interest irjj. inscriptions and tablets, one of the most important of which is erected by the Pennsylvania Sons of the Revolution, in honor of Captain William Shippen, who 'was killed at the battle of Princetown January 1777. On Tuesday afternoon a most elaborate breakfast wHs given the retiring delegates by the'lieneral Society l)..Js I 'will again reler you to Miss Sterling and Miss Snow for a cry complete account of thai delightful evCut, for they have both told it so well. Wednesday, April 26, we went to Valley Forge, and I am sure it was a dry never to be forgotten by any of us. We were met at the. Valley Korgc R. R. Station by large coaches in vhich we were dri,vtn all over the historic spots. Captain I. Heston Todd, who owns the greater part of Valley Forge, led the party and loinUd out and explained the points of interest. We know that the American army went into camp at this .place on the 19th of December, 1777. and remained there until June 19, 1778. This is an excellent place lor an encamp-- , ment. as thejiatural features of the country-woulenable the entrenchments to be made The Schuylkill river bounds very strong. ' it on one side; Valley Creek a large stream on the other. These two streams really take such a course as to encircle Valley F'orge on three sides, the other is protected by the earth works, planned by one of Lafayette's aid decamps. Modern engineers are puzzled by some of the fea-- . tures fh these earth works. General Washington's headquarters are at tht point where the Schuylkill and Valley, creek flow Fort Washin'gtti is nearest together. directly opposite the Schuylkill, and the headquarters of Lafayette and General Knox were at the end nearest' Valley creek, while those of General WTayne were at the other extremity of the Fort.-- Fort Hunt-- " ingdon is , almost directly oppositeWash- ington's and Wayne's headquarters, so that the four headquarters really represen t the four extremities of the army encampment.
