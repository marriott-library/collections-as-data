While some organizations of woaien are . established solely lot literary, social i.r philanthropic purjHise.;, n'ifdhers clubs may properly consider 'any subject pyrtajiV-- 0, to the cunditi.on of the human family. "Wlice tlje suriouinlings t hildii-- aut undesirable' and create immoral tendencies", the cooperatit)u of the mothers in changing the condition is very effectual, The true niutlier will consider the welfare, not nnlv inter ofjier own child ahme, hut m ested improving the condition of all children in her locality. The woman win takes into he: heart her own children mav he a very'ordinary woman, says .tlje .novelist, hut 'she who takes inttr her .heart the children of others, is one of God's mothers. The mother, too, receives her immuliate reward in helping to improve tlie condition of the youth in Iter community; for whatever elevates the moral standard ol 'children collectively will elevate the standard of the 7" individual child. "Here in the west he has greater K)wer than her sister in the east. She can vote foremen to go into office who will make just laws, laws which f.ivj)rsthe many and not the few, and influence legislation to the good of the community. "Womm's influence on the child, .011 the home and. on society, is recognized .and truly appreciated by- our fathers, brothers and husbands. A minister well known in ourcity has been quoted thus: 'A child may get along with an inferior kind of a father, but God pity hiurif he has a poor " excuse for a mother.' It is these imoi ex cuses of mothe-- s that the Mothers Club should endeavor to aul. Thev are not al ways poor excuses intentionally. hut through ignorance, through lack 6T education. Thev received no training, no teaching 'in their youth for the responsible position of parent hood, 111 consequence of which thev. have no system, no standard to guide them in the training of their own children. "The work of mothers' clubs is devoted to (he good of Others. Verv' seldom is the primary object. Necessarily ,the mothers are benefited bv their associating together, bnt their first thought is to bestow a benefit 'on others. their aim is wholly altruistic. If. as is claimed, all the great evils of life have their root 111 selfishness, mothers clubs with an altruistic motive must accomplish results just the reverse of evil. We do not expect to revolutionize the existing order of things but we can aid our fathers,-brotherand husbands in promoting a" better condition If we do this, ourefforts will ofsiety. be rewarded'" Mrs. Anderson led in the hymn, "Nean'r my jOci to 1 liee. wi-IL,bo- ' -- an.-modif- . and-elevatio- n self-cultur-e -- ; " s 1 1 MRS.

The time has arrived when is ias!taking.tiie place of inaividttal labor, that is, labor where one man or woman makes, an effort to carry or. successfully a number of occupations alone. For many years, the male" portion- of our population have seen the necessity of specializing their part of the labor; but the. mother is still toiling and wondering why she cannot be a success at child raising, cooking, washing, ironing, sewing, sweeping-- dusting, calling and entertaining.
