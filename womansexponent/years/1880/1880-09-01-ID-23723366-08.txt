During the excitement I queried wither it was worth so much expense, and finally concluded it was, as the rich foot the bills and it gives work to many worthy people, and an immense amount of money "changes hands; and in the long run these, celebrations do much good, besides keep ing the heart warm with the remembrance of our glorious American Constitution. "Three cheers for America, the home of the true and the brave." Nellie. UTAH COUNTY RILK ASSOCIATION. A pleasant gathering of the principal mem- bers of the Silk Association of this county convened at Father Graves gardens. In the shade of the beautiful avenue was a long table spread with "good things' which had been provided bv the sisters. About a hundred enests rar- took of the bounties spread: while thus enga the merry jest and sparkling repartee, the scenes,' fillinerc? the hearts of all with -a sense of joy and thankfulness for God's many mercies. "The guests then rambled around the pleasant grounds, visiting the cocoonery where IkojherGrraves is making a practical illustration of the enterprise he advocates so much. They were then called to order by Brother Ltfvelass, the Bishop remarked that we had met to enjoy ourselves, that the Bister had labored faithfully for enterprise which had been instituted by the Prophets of God.

Brother Paxman spoke of the growing labors of the sisters, that their duties would increase until the coming of the Savior. That this event was near at hand, and those who were striving to accomplish useful labors in temporal and spiritual things and live humbly, like the wise virgins who were prepared to go forth, when the cry comes, "Lo! the Bride-groocometh go ye out to meet him." That these duties were numerous, and one of them was silk raising. Said we must teach our children these things, that they might help to push on the kingdom of God. President Smoot was glad to meet with the sisters in this capacity, said he was informed that it was gaming strength, although its growth was slow hoped it would be sure. That silk could be produced from the elements, very cheanly, and when produced was always an article of commerce, that those who were not able to do very hard labor could engage) in the cultivation of silk, and by so doing they could help to sustain themselves, and increase Hoped the intelligent efforts of the would never cease until they had people fully the many resources of the Territory deyloped all engaged in the to out, of debt as debt had been enterprise therein of man? laudable enterprises; told the sisters to ask assistance of thel)rethren,when them to go on in this good work and needfnl,for all wise men and women would say, Amen.

That she had remembered these words, and when called upon to engage in this labor had cheerfully responded; also of a time when the sisters were assembled together at Lehi. President Young entered, and said, "What do I see before me? A congregation of Eves," how grand the thought,and while recalling the past " she was forcibly reminded of the time when Joseph Smith the Prophet walked up and down clapping his hands 'aud shouting "Hosannah! Hosannah! hosannah, to God, and the Lamb. I have now established on the earth what has not been since the time of Solomn's Temple." Exhorted the sisters to live those principles which unite and bind together, and seek for an increase of faith in God. The assembly sang "We thank thee O God for a prophet." Sister Margaret T. Smoot,spoke of the many things the sisters had to encourage them, that the brethren were one with them. That the remarks of Sister Young impressed her deeply. That they were calculated to inspire the soul of any one who had a soul,and hoped union would ever reign with the sisters. Sisters Beebe, of Provo, Douglas jof Payson, and Harrison of Springvill made some excellent remarks. The former eturning-thanks .to Brother Graves for his kindness. The latter said there had been 25 lb. of cocoons, and 5 oz. of eggs raised in Springville this year, by the Relief Society. Brother Z.
