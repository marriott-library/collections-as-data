Ex-io3fE- TT Plymouth, fortv miles from Bosfon, Mass.. ROMANIA B. PRATT famous for the landing of the Pilgrims in the bleak month of December, 1620, is at the present time a thriving town of seven thousand inhabitants, three or four miles in length, but very narrow, comparatively, in width. There are many very elegant residences overlooking the harbor. "Under a granite canopy is the identical rock where landed in the bleak winter, two hundred and sixty years ago, a band of exiles, who had moored their bark on the wild New England shore." A building is on the main now in process of street, which is to be devoted to the sacred relics of the fir-- t settlers. "An elliptical enclosure is near.containing a large boulder broken off from Plymouth Rock, on which is chiselled out the date, 1620, while in the festoons of the iron railing surrounding it are engraven the immortal names of the forefathers." The national monument, the memorial of the "toils, sacrifices and sufferings" of these renowned Pilgrims, is situated on an elevated site which overlooks the harbor, and when completed will be "a model of beauty," as well as of honor, to those brave, heroic, men and women who left home, friends and' country to obtain "civil and religious liberty" for themselves and their posterity, and all who should come to them for protection from tyranny and oppression. 01-se- n, songs. The house was crowded, every one seemed to be filled with joy and gratitude towards the children, to hear them slug and recite so beautifully. I thought if there were no children in heaven I should not want to be there. Elder I. C. Thorsen gave some good teachings on the Ten Commandments, followed by C. F, Olsen and C. Liljenquist. Rewards of merit were then distributed to the children, after which a picnic and party were given, under the able management of Lucy Wilson, the President. All enjoyed themselves exceedingly well, and it will be a day long to be remembered by the children. ng ET1T1F1N B. Pliyaioinn OFFICE Main on t Alice Unswortii, Cor. Sec'y.
