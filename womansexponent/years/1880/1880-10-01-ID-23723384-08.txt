But That will dehut? in the log happy now than we cultivate. pend entirely upon the spirit But to continue with our mechanical skill. What can 1 say? Language cannot express the artistic beauty and grandeur of the scene! And we feel to say, if so much has been done in this short period of time, what will the next thirty-thre-re-e years bring to us? One thing let us member; it is this; let us not become idolaters over the workmanship of our own hands. But let us remember the Author of all our blessings. He who has upheld and sustained us thus far, will enable us to endure to the end of the race, if we do not forget Ilim. It is written that the wicked shall lie turned into hell with all the nations who forget God. And have we not seen this verified many times when people became absorbed in the affairs of life; they seemed to Workman, forget that God was the Great Masterand our kind all science of head at the standing us never us. Let and to instruct guide Father all of Author the blessings. forget God, r Saints. We should tlo this with willing hands and then we arc only doing a little portion of the' worlc and bearing- some few of the. trial our mother- - and grandmothers were called to in the rU of the Church and the pas? through tiwt settling of Utah. There are no Societies here for the sisters, young, or old still we t do not despair-bu- t etrut that in a few short months we will have their good influence in our little settlement, There is a Sabbath School which I understand is a great help to the children. It will not be long before the Kail-roa- d will be quite near, then how anxiously will we look fur some of our dear sisters from Salt Lake and that region to pay us a visit. Even "now I can almost imagine I hear their kind voices and feel the heavenly influence they ever carry. Many of them 1 am person ly acquainted with, and to all I would say, may heaven's blessing be with you while you labor in this life for the welfare of Zion, and may the Exponent and its noble etfitor ever be prospered is the prayer of its friend. : as-ye- I St. John, Apache Gen.

Nor is this aJJ,seven times seven years in pros-erit- y have passed away since the Lord restored the Everlasting Covenant; preparatory to His second coming. Do you ask is this without trials? I answer, No. Yet in our most severe trials, we could go to God our Father for wisdom, and learn that it was all for our best good. Thus our afflictions were sanctified to us, and greater intelligence given; m that the wound was healed and we weut on our way rejoieeiug. Hard indeed to lose our prophet; but was not the same intelli- gence given, to twelve others to carry on the work. Also in the case when five hundred men were called to go to the Mexican war. This seemed too much to a traveling community, trying to find a resting place. But what was the result? This land belonged to Mexico, and when a treaty was made, were we not entitled, to home.i in these valleys? Most certainly. In this again wo saw our Father's hand. This is but one instance of the many. But whose carriages are these with beautiful black horses? Oh! I see! The faithful and true! the veterans of the day. Faithful in what, do you ask?
