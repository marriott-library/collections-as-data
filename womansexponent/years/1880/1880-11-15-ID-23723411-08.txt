WOMAN'S EXPONENT 96 contributed since last January, making a sum total of $9,80, in sums ranging from one egg to sixty cents. Some very pretty cards, as rewards of merit, were presented to the larger children, while smaller ones were given to every child present. Our Association numbers 235 members. The second annual meeting will le a time long to be remembered by the happy little ones. Our city friends stayed several (lays in SpatH ish Fork attending meetings, visiting friends and doing good. We wish such visitors would NOTES AND NEWS. The following extract from an Indiana woman's letter to a friend and published in full in Boston, Woman's Journal explains itself. George W. Julian spoke here to an immense audience. The old expressions "beautifully infernal," "delightfully satanic," which I fcre again and again heard him apply to Democrats in days of yore, sounded very familiar as they fell from his lips. But the application, now y how different! they are, used against and to tickle Democratic Republican leaders, ears. Well do I remember when "he would hang and hang liberally" these same Democratic friends who how applaud his every utterance. Oh, dear! what a queer world this is, anyYou never know what your nearest way! friend will do next. And I will only reiterate in conclusion that I am disgusted and sick. One thing I always said I would not do, was to live with a Democrat. Certainly I never would have married one. Now comes the con' undruni when you marry a IJepublican, and he urns to a Democrat what can you do? .m Loyally yours, B. J. M, Hannah Cornaby. come often. To-da- WOMANiS VOICE I often think that I would like to mingle my voice with the rest of my sisters, in regard to the work in which we are all engaged: we are somewhat isolated from the main body of the Church. We are trying to serve the Lord, I believe. We were joined yesterday by a company of our brethren and sisters from Sanpete, Utah, which will help very much to strengthen us here. Our town is growing very fast; we have a Relief Society here, also Young Men's and Young ladies' Mutual Improvement Associations, but we are, just beginning; I hope they will prove a great success. The people here seem to be alive to their duties, and are interested in the good work. The Gospel is beginning to spread among the Mexicans, who seem to be a d people, but they have a to overcome. I think of deal tradition great that we can do about as much by example here as We can by preaching. Not wishing to intrude, I will close, ever wishing success to the Exponent.

Without intending it their manner is repellantj and if they have a fair share of combativeness, antagonistic to such an, extent as to make their society unsough t and disagreeable,. They receive favors ungraciously, and grant them in such a manner as makes the recipient regret having asked them. But the naturally agreeable person both accepts and confers a favor in a manner delightful to witness. My life was saved by Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure. Ii. B. Lakely, Selma, Ala. A Happy Restoration. I can truly say that I owe my present existence and happy restoration to the hopes and joys of life, to the use of Warner's Safe Kidney and Liver Cure, and I say to every one suffering from any manner of kidney, liver and urinary trouble, "Use this W.

Reports of havoc by the earthquake have been received at Agram from the whole surrounding country. Agram, 1 1. Fresh earthquakes threw down many houses, causing a fearful panic. . patches, but some important and interesting details which could not be telegraphed are herewith giyeo. The new celestial visitor is in the Constellation of Pegasus, right ascension, 21 hours, 30 minutes, declination north 17 degrees, 30 minutes. Its rate of motion is. very glow, being in a northwesterly direction, so that it is approaching the sun. It has a very strong condensation on one side of the centre? in additon to a star-lik- e nucleus, which indicates that it. is throwing off an extended tail. From the fact of its extraordinary size, we'are warranted in presuming that it will be very brilliant, and the additional fact that it is coming almost directly toward the earth, gives good promise that it will be one of the most remarkable comets ' of the present century. This is the fifth comet which Prof.8wift has discovered, and the increased facilities which Mr. W, II. Warner, the popular and wealthy medieine man, has given him, by erecting a magnificent observatory for his benefit, promises much more for the future. There is a possibility that further developments may prove thi.i to be the great comet of 1812, which U being constantly expected, in which event astronomers will have an unusual opportunity to test the spectroscope for the first time upon tnese eccentric txxiica, and ascertain cer- rolnlu mhar (hair of ' .
