Here is his and firm as when it rested upon his imin 773. perial brow after the siege at Pavia Here is his stole, his girdle, his sword. Here - are his coronation robes and his sceptre; the imperial globe which was never held by a firmer grasp than when the mighty' king put hh strno- hand unon it." The present century seems the one that is dim and far away as we stead in "a dazed condition. These famous relics of the "Emperor of the West" were found in his tomb at Aix La Chapelle. When the vault was opened he was found sitting in most regal state on a throne, A mightier despot Bat side by side with the imperial body. Death alone had curbed the spirit of this. " mighty warrior king. France had cause to take great pride in this wonderful sovereign, Lombardy to bateJiim, Italy, Spain, Germany to fear him. Learning, art and science owe much to his patronage. He was as extraordinary as despotic. We seem to come almost into his visible presence as we stand gazing at the old crown. We are quite content, however, with our own day as we shake off the illusions which -gather around us. There is another great country beyond the sea where .trade and - industry find a home, where ; art, and science where there is free thought... , are encouraged, and free speech, liberty ofcohscience and room for all who crave it. There are no old coro- - ; nation robe3 hanging on the walls of its treasury; no crowns whose wearers have put their iron heels on the hearts of its children. Charlemagne's hour is over. A grander nation has risen a West which he never r ; dreamed of. The Prater us the grand park of the city,' where all visitors delight to- - drive. Grand carriages of the nobility are daily the admira-- ; tion of the walking public. We hunt up the old buildings frescoed on the outside, admire the fountains and statues, roam through the quaint sections of the place, and wish we had weeks to spend within its walls. We could be busy all the time hunting up new sights and old curiosities. When we turn from here it will be with regret; but everywhere we leave much unseen which we shall hunger and thirst for in the days to come. We generally coax ourselves off with the promise that "next time" we shall do all these wonderful things which we leave undone now. If the promise is never to be quite fulfilled,:we: go ' away rather more , " cheerful for our little delusion. If we had all our lives to live over, we half suspect we might after all leave out some things we would be loth to do without. In the morning Vienna will be a long way behind us. We have, had a royal feast within, her gates. The banquet been both rich and rare. We are more , has v fortunate than the Romans of old; we turn - away before our appetite is wholly appeased. 1 Ex.
