Let 'the rich fatten the3e shopkeepers; the humbler class cannot afford to be charitable. There, is no fixed price for one in ten of the necessary commodities. Peaches are til ty cents a basket or a dollar a basket, not accorcliDg to quality, but according to the seller and the place where sold. It is well to buy of the dollar man if we wish to help him along, but if the buyer needs help he would better look up the fifty-ceman the peaches being the same. The millionaire sends out and purchases a clothes wringer for three dollars; that is well; it helps the seller; but the humbler housekeeper can buy the same article exactly s for of that '. sum.- - One thing is certain, that nothing is more flexible and submissive than this very expense bill.

Ihis way of dispensing one's income is to a notable extent an attribute of a certain class of women. Men- who more generally earn their money, are usually more select in their methods of spending while they also spend more liberally. Women of wealth seldom, fling money , about so lavishly, as having been accustomed to its use they better under- stand what money represents. As a usual free-and-ea- GROCERIES GOODS, MOTIONS, HEAVY" AND BHELF ITARDWAJRE, is one involving several : amusement-going- interests. Unquestionably the money invested in a good dramatic performance or a line opera is a better investment than if put in the bank. It is capital invested in the culture of life; But who are you who have no interests, no entertainment, no occupation at home, that you must each night contribute your money, and your time to a company of strolling players, whose performance may -- be all very well for empty-headepeople who must be externally amused, but is quite the reverse for one who has in himself the power of intellectual activity.
