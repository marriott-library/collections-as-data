Bo, you see, dear friends, wby I fear stepping iuto religious mud; there is always one thing or another in the way to prevent my faith from taking root. And yet X wish to be religious, and while I am wait ing, like Micawber, I will live up to my favor ite texts, by speaking well of the Mormons every time an opportunity U given; will, break down my against the Mormon Church as far as I can, and will ask you to remember the fact that your opponents here, hear only the evil that your light has not yet shone here,, that men seo your good works and glorify God thereby. Forget, so far aa you can the wrongs of the past the past is dead; let the dead past bury its dead. All lovers of God should lay aside bitterness and evil speaking one against another, and join in one grand array against the evils of the world.
