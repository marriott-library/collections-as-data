Association here and have been ever since ary it commenced. I am now eleven years old, and feel very thankful to have the privilege of going to those little meetings. I always try to do - what my president and counselors tell me to do. And I am happy to say that our meetings are improving very rapidly; and we have received a pretty little card with those beautiful words," "Children, love each other." Yes," that is our motto, and we should love each other, and above all our Heavenly Father. Our meetings . are very interesting, and I would counsel my young brothers and sisters to attend to their meetings, because I know the Lord blesses us in so doing; and be obedient to our parents and attend to our prayers, that the Spirit of, the Lord may rest upon us, to guide us through life, th at wo may grow up to be honorable men and women in the Kingdom of God . We should "read good" books and attend to our Sunday Schools and every meeting that we possibly "can. And we should keep the commandments of God, and we will be sure of our salvation.- May this be our; happy lot, i3 ""' my prayer. I remain, your sister in the Gospel, Marinda Monson. .
