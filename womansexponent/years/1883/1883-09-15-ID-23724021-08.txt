J. Cfocheron is something ' original in its" character. The picture represents the three distinct organizations, viz.: Relief Society, Young Ladies Associations and .Primary Association not only by the portraits of the officers, but by characteristic symbols. Theology, Metiieine, Literature, Art and Musio are also represented in the same way. The drawing is by the lady herself, lithographed in New York. Mrs. C. has displayed considerable talent for drawing art istically, and the "work should certainly meet with encouragement on that account, as well as perpetuating in the memory the institutions and labors ot the women in the Church.
