They are all wonderfully decorated, n one of them is a statue of Eugene Beauhar-nai.crowned as a Greek hero.

AVhen she was nominated a m,n was her opponent, but the vote waa carried by t the first time I ever went to the theatre a hat; all the ladies took off their wrapa and hats, and I think the idea is a very censlble one, for sometimes it is quite annoying to sit behind a Rreat, big hat and have one's view obstructed. I.must tell you I have seen a queen. As we with-ou- , walked down Maximijlian Btraucse we met tbe mother q jeeu with another lady and 3 guard taking a morning walk.. Every one stopped and bowed to her. The last day we were in Munich we went to tht Falace, and were shown through some of the room?. .
