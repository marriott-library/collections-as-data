V" Your faith and works arc earnestly desired ' in the cause of Mutual ' Improvement. The Presidency of the Church, in its wisdom; has organized these Associations that I he young people in Zion'may have aii opportunity unacquiring knowledge and learning how to use it, that they may become acquainted "with the writings of .inspired men, with the science of theology, and the truths found in science, Li-- torv, literature and art. ;37"jt rnrTirrt si ep in this work t itnprcA'ing out-"- " selves, is to learn the will of our JstlliLr in Heaven. We may do this by reading eiiruul-.-l- y the Bible, Church works, amL other grA,-book- s; by listening to the instructions oFl lis authorize:d servants; by being humble, prayerful, and obedient to those in authority; by -- -- ; ; - seek in g gpd ttreTauTifuTperformauce ityaMof all duties which mlre upturns of Zioir. de- ' " . , Search the Scriptures and Church Works, Jnform ourselves' that we ' may be able to dc-fend the )rinciples of our faith, and teach the glorious truth to younger brothers and sisters. It is not our mission to go abroad and labor among the nations of the earth, but we have a great and noble work to do at home.
