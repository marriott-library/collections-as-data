The scenes witnessed at Worcester the last week are significant The time was when , such, displays would have been impossible in this good old common, wealth. But our population is fast chang. ing, and with the change of population has come the change in manners and morals. The class that dominated at Worcester lately is likely at no very dlis tan t. day to be the ruling class in this State. The power which has been held by the honest yeomen of the rural districts ever since the old colonial days has passed into the hands of the cities, and the cities are fast, coming into the control of the foreign masses that are ruled and - governed by a forei gn priesthood. The cities will rulo the State in less than ten years. Who rule the cities now? Who will rule the cities in ten years? Analyze the vote of Boston for the answer. Walk through Fall River, Lowell and Worcester for the answer. The foreign elements, combined with the irresponsible part of the native population, will soon have political supremacy. (They will ruiB the cities. Already it Woiild he Jm possible to elect a temperance manas raaydrof. Boston.
