WOMAN'S EXPONENT. 136 THE OPPOSING PARTY. this What mcaneth the sound of tumult of their the force array of words, trying by us? The spirit ot power to bring trouble upon are the evil one inspires the wicked, and they for ' tools in his hands in this, hi last struggle are numbered, power and supremacy. His days his time is short, and with increased force and oi venom he raises his hand against the people Saints. He stirs up the Lord, the Latter-da- y the hearts of his followers to warfare with the seek to living God. It is not polygamy they seek to exterminate, but by that as a handle exterminate the truth and drive it from the earth, as once before it was driven. Will they succeed? No, never! they cannot do it, for the Lord has promisedand it will endure. Howl on, corrupt politicians! Howl on, ye who 6ught to be ministers of peace, but who are ministers of war! The honest in heart will stand back aghast at your proceedings, and in their'hearts will condemn your works. Evil spirits may rage, and Satan may plan, all. all will be confounded, for the Lord has spoken and His word is true. Celestial marriage, that gives us power over death, that unites in heaven as well as on earth, that has no dissolution in it, is the present target. Celestial marriage, that brings the blessfrom ings of the Lord, that is a commandment aim to at. Really heaven, is what they pretend from the truth of is heaven, the it kingdom God, and the people who obey the commandments of God, against whom their hatred exists. The same God who heard the prayer of Hezekiah and smote the army of Senacharib will hear our prayers and smite those who oppose us. The same God that delivered Daniel from the lion's den will deliver us. In Him we trust. The power of the wicked will be broken, and righteousness at last prevail. Emily B. Spencer. The Misses Kollock are four typical western girls. The family of W. E. and AM. Kollock, of Madison, Wis., consists of seven members, four of whom are sisters. Of these, Dr. Mary Kollock Bennett, the eldest, graduated at the Woman's Medical College of Chicago, and for many years has been practising successfully in that city. The next, Dr. Harriet Kollock, graduated in the medical department at Ann Arbor, Mich., nine years ago, since which time she has been eminently successful in her professional works. The third, Rev. Florence Kollock, graduated at Canton Theological College some years since, and is now doing a good work as a pastor in a beautiful church, built for her by the parish during the last two years, at Englewood, a fine suburban town of Chicago. Dr. Jennie C. Kollock, the youngest sister, graduated in the dental department of Ann Arbor, Michigan, last March, together with a class of thirty-si- x gentlemen, she being and the only lady, passing the highest examination of any in the class. She is now establishing herself successfully as a dental practitioner in Chicago. Ex. The Woman Suffrage Hearing. , the women of Massachusetts. She appealed to the committee to make the case ot tne women their own. She said: "The torn battle flags in the rotunda show the strife men have made for men. We have liberty and equal rights for no battle flags to show for our cause, but thirty devoted to the years of our lives lie behind us for great purpose of securing equal rights' women. We have seen our youth and middle life pass from us in a vain asking for rights which all men have without asking, and now, with old age coming on, we are stiU petitioning for this sacred right of suffrage. Ex. ,Augusta Moore says in the Evangelist "Itook up paper one day and saw nineteen divorces in it. I took up another and saw five. I went to a certain church and found there, in full communion, a woman who has two husbands. I visited the house of 'a leading member' in a, church, and found there a minister who has divorced one wife (a virtuous woman), and is married to another. I know a minister who married a doctor to a woman for whom he had divorced his excellent wife. This was in Clinton, Ct. Time would fail me to particularize the cases of this sort that I know, and I live among the best people that there are in this world. These cases are as plenty everywhere as they are about me indeed, much more so in many localities. A friend writes me from California that it is hardly safe to say 'divorce,' so many of 'the very nicest people' have two or three husbands or wives living. Now, is not this an encouraging state of things? Is it any wonder that some ministers are telling us how fast the world is growing better, how the very millennium is upon us? It is to be feared we can hardly exert just the moral influence that is needed over the Mormons till the States are reformed. Prof. Austin Phelps says: 'We are not half awake to the fact that by our laws of divorce and our toleration of the social evil, we are doing more to corrupt the nation's heart than Mormonism, tenfold.'
