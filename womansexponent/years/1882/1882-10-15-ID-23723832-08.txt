But if there is so much intelligence, and so great for no other reason- " involves, no harm can surely., come from the ballot; it would then become a the wife who vote against her saiety-.valvhusband ; ha3 simply neutralized . the vote sho doesn't believe in, and there' i3 no further ground of quarrel over a mere difference of e; . - -opinion. Laughter and applause. But, objects another, it is not because the women do think or dp not think just like their "husbands that I oppose woman suffrage, but because none of the women want to vote. This certainly shows a remarkable deference in the male voter to the, opinion of those who have no political influence. But perhaps the woman who doesn't want the ballot has never been frankly asked whether she does; perhaps the husband's ridicule, scorn and contempt have prevented a free declaration. ...When I. hear men saying that they are willing that women should vote, but. they do not wish it and therefore they (the men) will not vote for the amendment, I say that I respect the ballot too much to make plea; not on this ground, but because you frankly do not believe in woman suffrage, should you vote against it. For such an expression of individual conviction, and not for the puerile plea urged, do I have respect. " ZZ Zr' ; Applause. Again, I hear it objected that your pure wivc3 and daughters must not be brought down into the - mire of politics. My father, and brother, and husband, have always voted, and they stand there in "the mire of polities'' with unsullied-feet- , and with a pure heart and clean hands. But if politics be so base, who made it so ? "Whatever their conditions are they are" conditions of manhood's making. But this is .the old argument of the ages to keep woman subordinate, not tyranically but in ignorance. This argument, 'til within afew generations kept women from the table with men kept girls out of schools, and it kept women out of the professions - and- - trades. Why, then, did God send boys and girls in. the same family ? The struggle in Boston over the admission of girls to the public schools was recounted: aud Â¬ within ten .years that they have en- it is ,only . . t ".i.itne .Doys, nor nave tereu tne .uatin scnoois witn their morals been corrupted. And now, at last, everywhere, women - have, entered the schools, the professions and the trades, thev have become the queen3 of the' social world, and self-helpf-ul not have tho same effect on'American it, women ? Shall we not, like you, grow in dig? In reply to the objection nity and that woman has no real reason for voting, the speaker said that hianjdaimed the need of itto. "" protect his property and his occupation. Woman, it k true, has less property than man; -- but asvI need it, the less, I have thejnore need that T be able to protect it. But women as well as men have industrial interests. In place of seven occupations thirty years t, ago the women of Indiana now have and those of New England have 85; and in Indiana 21,000 women mako their living in productive industries. If there were but 21, X)O0 men in Nebraska who thus made their living, would they not need the ballot as much as do the 90,000 now V. In conclusion the speaker pictured Tthedelight reign in women's hearts when they could stay at home and enjoy protection in their sphere by . enjoying their rights outside of it. Wewant the ballot to protect us in that sphere, what- : , ever it is. Ex. - . IFJ OBSTETRIGS. epeckl request ot Ms. K. It. SHOW SMITH Dr. ROMANIA B.
