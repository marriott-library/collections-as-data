WO MA N'S E X P ON E N T , 128 Concord, Middlesex Co., Mass., July 20, 1881. Mrs. H. T. King : ' How I wish you were here! for certainly you would thoroughly enjoy this atmosphere of intellectual refinement. You know Boston is the Athens of America, and in Concord are the classic groves of the modern Athens; for Boston approaches nearer to the Athens of Socrates and Plato than any other city in the world, and it would be difficult to find grander historic associations, or a My Dear Friend richer galaxy of great minds, that make Con- cord brie of the world's hallowed p!ces. Here was fired the shoi that awakened the world to a sense ot their own individual rights; here began that glorious struggle that gave liberty to naif the world, and revealed the goddess in her true beauty to the other half. Here, too, lived Hawthorne, pur greatest writer of romance, author of "The Scarlet Letter," "Marble Fawn," "House of Seven Gables" and a host of other works of marvelous beauty. Yesterday I visited his grave, a spot Secluded on a hilltop, a beautiful valley rolling away from its base, and over and around it lofty pines bend and sigh and. sob, as if the burdens of humanity had passed into them. Here, too, lived Thoreau, the American Jean Jacques Rousseau; here, in lonely woods on the shore of a fairy-lik- e pond, he endeavored to show us that man can be sufficient unto himself without society. Here the Transcendental Schobl met and -- and taught a new gospel roused from woman her Fuller Margaret ob-zfcu- re minstrel-see- r, Here lives our gioriousj saintly Emerson, ready now, alas! to gink into the grave. Still he comes sometimes to our lectures, bringing with him an atmosphere of heaven. The bright practical face of "Aunt Jo" is seen also at our meetings. Of course you know Louisa Aicott, authoress of "Little Wod men' Girl," &c. Dear Aunt Jo! beloved of every heart whether young or old I We walked home with her one evening, and she talks just as she writes. Her father, A. Bronson Aicott, the patriarch of philosophers, a grand old man of eighty years, as fresh, as spiritual, as quaint as ever. Concord has always been a favorite resort of literary people, of thinkers, and well it might; its walks, shaded with elms, some of them two hundred years old, its woods' and fairy-lik- e lakes' (they call thera ponds hcire), its hills and undulating fields, its beautiful homes and its quiet and repose, although only twenty miles from Boston, a dozen or so of trains passing every day; yet it is as calm and peaceful as a country village. I have kept the great thing for the last. In this quiet, rural nook, possessing at most 2500 souls, is a free public library of 1600 volumes. I know I shall feel homesick when the moment of departure comes, as it will in a few "Old-fashione- LITTLE LETTER. Morgan City, Dec, A- - -- The boys made rakes, knives, forks, lounges, whips, rolling-pin&c. The girls made pies and cakes, worked tidies, and one of the girls, about twelve years old, took a piece of every one of the Primary children's hair, and the President's and her two Counselors'. Then she put the boys' on one side of the hair work andk the girls' on the other side, and the President's and Counselors' above worked in hearts. Sister Porter, the President, takes great pains with the children. She teacher them to sing, and at the Fair they sang very sweetly. I hope you will be permitted to come and visit us again next summer, for the Primary children would like to see you now. My" mother sends her very kind love to you, and hopes you are well. Accept the same from myself. Yours affectionately, Fair, and it was splendid. s, s, ox-yoke- DRY GOODS, HEAVY .

And now, my dear friend, how are you"? physically, I mean,-- for your mental condition is ever fresh and active witness those articles on Disraeli. "Was the poem, ' Reminiscences' a late work, or is it of an earlier date? It touched me very much. As faT as regards Disraeli, l am not an enthusiast; certainly I admire him a? areally man of strange destinies, an historical phenomenon, o to epeak, but being a liberal heart and oul IfcTOTICEi. see you to the conservatives. are now agitating that movements in the great the Northern States of Europe? It seems to me that a great struggle is preparing; what its issue will be we cannot well say, but one thing is certain, the birth of liberty for all the world is at hand. ' The next great question after Nihilism, is the revision of the New Testament. For some weeks before my departure from Romeo, the revision was the one absorbing theme. Will you give me your ideas upon it ? I will write mine and send them to you at my first leisure. Some of them seem to me quite radical.
