TT JL 0 SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. - fifty-nint- 1868. rr The following obituary notice has been overlooked, for With feelings of deep sadness I record the death of . another faithful, untiring and dearly beloved member of the Relief Society of Kamas. Sister Mary Lewis departed h this life May 29th, in fcer year, leaving to mourn Bro. her beloved her loss Morgan Lewis, vith companion, whom she had gathered to Son from their native country, Wales, and with whom she had uncomplainingly passed through such hardships as few, even of the early settlers of these mountain vales, were called to endure, Together they had nursed through thirteen years of suffering a dearly loved daughter, who was. in childhood stricken with that terrible malady, rheumatism, and lingered' in much suffering for years, till her pure spirit was freed by death. In a little less than four years Tier mother has followed her, leaving, also, a daughter and four sons, the oldest of whom is a helpjess invalid, having for two years been afflicted with the same disease that carried off his sister. For his sake the fond mother desired to tarry, saying, "Joseph is getting better now, and I long to see him once more on his feet; and to His will T bow." In her the afflicted of our com-- " munity have found a true and tender consoler. She was ever patient, cheerful and charitable, and our Society has lost one of the most faithful of its members. The deepest sorrow and sympathy js felt for the bereaved family, and fervently we pray the blessings of God on them, that they, may acknowledge His hand, and that they may follow, her bright example.'
