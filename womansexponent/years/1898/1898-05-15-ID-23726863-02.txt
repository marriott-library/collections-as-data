Marriage is embraced without an iota of knowledge of the physical, environments that make motherhood a glory. and a song. Girls should he educated to a proper knowledge of the responsibilities they are to undertake when, they embrace matrimony. The physical redemption of women would mean the glorification of mankind. -- .", DISSIPATION OF All the fears and all the curses that now so ruthlessly surround motherhood by -- reason of the ignorance of the laws of nature arid of God would be dissipated if the young girls were properly and purely made acquainted with the physical laws they should obey and which are to govern their future and the future of humanity as well.Mrs. Sorensen spoke with a slight Ger- man accent which made her address piquant but in no manner retarded the easy flow of her strong afnirmpTtsive ' sentences. In concluding her address she made a vigorous plea in favor of vegetarianism, declaring herself to be a vegetarian. She created much amusement by stating that she believed she was a little wiser than when she "ate the animals up." She created another round of laughter when she said: "I am proud to be a wo; man. I wouldn't be a man for anything m the world, and I wouldn't hive .a man to want to be a woman. Each has a sphere and each is dependent upon the other." Mrs. Sorensen in conclusion, paid a high tribute to the movement and its. leaders and was applauded for several minutes. A discussion of the' two papers was invit-e- d by the president, and an interesting interchange of views was indulged in, particularly on Mrs. SchofPs paper, by a number of the delegates. - : MRS.

Mrs. Hensley who spoke from one of the private boxes, was very earnest in her approval of the argument Mrs. Sorensen had "advanced. She said she had long been "amazed at the mock, modesty which had prevented the proper consideration of the subject Mrs. Sorensen, had so intelligently ; treated.
