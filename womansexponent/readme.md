Woman's Exponent Data

Woman’s Exponent was a Salt Lake City-based newspaper that ran from 1872 to 1914, and covered topics germane to Mormon women, ranging from domestic affairs, church events, to national topics such as slavery and the suffrage movement.  In partnership with Brigham Young University, the University of Utah’s Digital Matters scanned and OCR’d the entire run and is making the plaintext available for general use.
