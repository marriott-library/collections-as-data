This collection of obituary data was developed in partnership with the University of Utah Marriott Library and Family search, and is made available freely for anyone to use with a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license, [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

Currently the collection contains obituary data from Box Elder News and the Davis County Clipper, along with a key to fields to aid in interpretation.

We plan on exploring methods of making further obituary data from [Utah Digital Newspapers](https://digitalnewspapers.org/) available in the future.
