[The Harold Stanley Sanders Matchbooks Collection](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/search?page=10&facet_setname_s=uum_hssm) consists of 678 matchbooks that were collected by Harold "Stan" Sanders, the father of local Salt Lake city legend, Ken Sanders, which is part of the [Harold Stanley Collection, 1803-2002](http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv08935/) held in the [Marriott Library Special Collections](https://www.lib.utah.edu/collections/special-collections/). While it is difficult to date these matchbooks, it is estimated they were made during the 1930s to the 1970s and reflect many bygone establishments; including restaurants, bars, hotels and even fuel companies in Salt lake City and other areas of Utah.

As matchbooks are a form of advertising, they include street addresses of the business being promoted. Included in the metadata is latitude and longitude for these locations. Additionally, notable graphics and colors found on the matchbooks has been included as well.
