This is part of a series of interviews I am doing for the American West Center at the University of Utah. We are working on a history of Carbon County, and particularly on coal mining in Carbon County. You wrote that you were born in Greece. Is that right?
Yes, I was born on the Island of Crete. Oh, you were? When were you born?
1913.
When did you come to America?
When I was two years old.
So, your parents--?
I came to Ambridge, Pennsylvania.
Yes.
See, my mother is Greek, or Cretan, and my father is an Englishman .
Oh .
He was in the English navy. See, that is him up there. There is a picture of him up there in the middle there.
I see.
He died just last year. He was ninety-six years old when he died. My mother died when we lived in Kennilworth. How old was she then?
About fifty; not quite fifty.
So after you were in Pennsylvania, then where did you

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
live?
EM: I was going to tell you about my mother. My mother was a
cook for the Princess of England. NT: Was she?
EM: Yes, she did the cooking for the Princess of England, and she worked in England as a cook taking care of different people there. She used to take care of the Captain's wife, Hyde Parker. She used to take care of his wife too. That is where she met my dad. They came and they were married on the Island of Crete. Then they were married again aboard ship. That was the time when the Turks were invading Suda Bay. I mean the Turks were invading the Island of Crete, and the Englishmen came over there to kick them off the island. That is when my dad quit and got out of the navy, and he opened up a saloon in Suda Bay. As long as the navy was in there, he was doing all right. Just as soon as the navy left, and occupational forces left, he didn't have enough money to bring my mother and me to Pennsylvania. He got on a ship, and he got a job in Ambridge, Pennsylvania in the steel mills. He worked for the United States Steel, I think and U.S. Metal Molding there in Ambridge. I don't know if you know where the town of Ambridge is at. We lived down in the part of the town there called Economy. That is where the
"economists," used to be, the Quakers. It was all Quaker

country, see. Then I had another sister. She was born in Pennsylvania. I had two sisters born in Pennsylvania. The other sister was born here in West Hiawatha.
NT: So, when did your family come to Utah?
EM: We came...well, my uncle was staying there with us in
Pennsylvania. Then he left and came back here to Utah to the coal mines. He wrote my dad a letter and told my dad, "You better come here to Utah to the coal mines here. They make more money than you do down there in the steel
mills. "
NT: What was your uncle's name?
EM: His name was Mike Stambalakis. So, my dad left there. We
left Pennsylvania in about 1915. In 1916 we were here in West Hiawatha. That is where my dad worked. He worked in the West Hiawatha mine. He helped the machine man where they used to cut coal. He was a machine man. In the meantime , the mine foreman, who was an Englishman too , told my dad, "That is no job for you, helping on a machine. You take a test and become a shot fire. We need shot fires real bad." So my dad trained to be a shot fire, and he was a shot fire. Then after that, he trained and took his examination to become a fire boss, and he became a fire boss. In the meantime, my mother got sick again . My mother got sick , and there was no doctor around here that could take care of her. So we had to go all
3

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
the way back to Pennsylvania.
NT: Oh, my goodness.
EM: Yes. And while we were back there, I had one sister die
there from whooping cough. When she died from whooping cough, then my dad, he went up over his head. He said, "I am not going to stay around this darn place and have all my kids die of all these sicknesses." Because there were so many people there, you see. So, we came back to Utah here. In about 1919 it was, he worked in West Hiawatha. Then he went to work in West Hiawatha. We stayed in West Hiawatha until 1924. Then they closed West Hiawatha down and shipped us all over to Mohrland, Utah. Do you know where Mohrland is at?
NT: Yes, I do.
EM: Then, while my dad was there, he couldn't get along with
the general manager there, the superintendent of the mine there. He had it in for my dad because my dad was what they call "Otto Harris Man." See, Otto Harris was the Vice President of the United States Fuel Company. He couldn't get along with him, so my dad quit ... didn't quit. This one fellow that used to be a safety engineer for United States Fuel Company in Blackhawk, he went to Idaho. So he told my dad to come to Idaho. So my dad took and moved to Idaho from Mohrland. We moved to Idaho in 1927. It was all right for a while there. But, you see,
4

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
there the coal was different than our coal that we have here. The coal there runs up and down, almost straight up and down.
NT: Oh.
EM: Yes. That is on account ... my dad was saying there used to
be a geologist there that was a good friend of my dad. He was kind of running that company there. He told my dad that it was caused by a volcano, an eruption there in the Idaho district. Where this mine was at was in Sam, Idaho.
NT: Sam?
EM: Sam, Idaho they call it. Named Sam, Idaho because they
named that mine after a trapper that used to be in there. He used to trap, and he discovered that mine in there. His name was Sam Michaelson. He used to prospect the Teton Peaks and he went all over in there into Sam. They also had another little mine up in there that they called
"The Brown Bear" because it was discovered by a brown bear.
NT: Really?
EM: Yes, the brown bear discovered this coal. I went to
school there in the seventh grade or the eighth grade in a log cabin, a single room log cabin school with one teacher. She used to get around to me but once a day. I had to know all of the answers. Her name was Michaelson too. That was her husband's brother tat was Sam Michael-

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
son. We had it pretty rough in there. We couldn't make any money. some way or another the governor of Idaho, he didn ' t want that coal mine to go or something, and he wrecked the whole darn thing there. So my dad said, "We w ill have to get back out. " So, in the meantime , he wrote to a friend of his that he knew here in Utah whose name is Teddy Jones. He was the superintendent of the Wattis Coal Company. He say, "Yes, come on Bill. Come on over and we will give you a job. I will give you a job." We had to stay there because we didn't have enough money to leave. We couldn't get the car fixed to drive here to Utah. So my dad worked in the coal mine for two months, I think it was. In the meantime, he found a fellow down here who used to run a trucking service here in Price. He used to run a stage line to Sunnyside and Hiawatha and Spring Canyon and all over. He says, "I will go get your furniture bill for you and you can pay me when you get the money. That is what he did. So, we came back here in 1929. We lived in Wattis. There is no high school in Wattis. You had to go to Price. My dad didn't have the money to send me to high school in Price because you had to stay in the dorm down here in those days. So, I used to walk along the railroad tracks to Hiawatha, to Black Hawk. But, they changed the name of Black Hawk to Hiawatha later on. They shut everything down all the way
6

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
around, so they decided to name the town there Hiawatha instead of Black Hawk. I used to walk in the morning and at night back and forth to school. It was four miles along the railroad tracks.
NT: Did they have a high school in Black Hawk?
EM: Yes. They didn't have a high school. They had a grade
school there, but they had the ninth grade, see. NT: Yes.
EM: But before that when we lived in West Hiawatha, we used to ... I belonged to Boy Scouts up there. We used to come down to Hiawatha there on father's and son's outings and have contests and that. I learned a lot about first aid and things like that. I learned a lot about first aid because that is all they taught us was first aid. All of the coal miners, they taught first aid there. The instructors were first-class first aid instructors which helped me a lot later on in years.
NT: Yes.
EM: After we got in Wattis, it was a while there until this
superintendent got killed thee in the mine right along- side my dad. They just brought in a new loading machine that run on tracks. I don't know what the name of it was. My dad says they were loading there and a car jumped the track, so he picked up a hammer to go spike the real because it moved. He walked over there, and when he
7

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
walked over there the roof come down and killed this
Teddy Jones . NT: Oh, no.
EM: Yes. So after that they had quite a heck of a hell of a blue there . There was a bunch of coal miners there . The thing was this , that my dad ... there was diggers and machine men, you know. W ell, those machine men , they wanted to load coal. See, after they had cut their places, they want to load coal. My dad told them, "No. That belongs to the differs. The differs don't make hardly anything and you want all of their money too." Well, this one guy, he put a protest in, and he went to the general manager and had my dad kicked out of there on account of that.
NT: Oh, no.
EM: Yes, because he was trying to help the poor digger.
NT : EM:
NT: EM:
Gee .
In the meantime, he knew some friend over in Kennilworth. So, my dad moved and went over to Kennilworth there . They gave him a job in Kennilworth as a fire boss in the mine.
What year was that?
Oh, let's see. That was 1929. Then we moved to wattis because I went to Carbon High school in 1930 in my sophomore year. So, I stayed there. My dad worked there rather, and I was around there. Then we got to know the
8

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
superintendent of the mine, the mine foreman of the mine whose name was George Ackson... (?) . His wife, she knew we didn't have any money, so she used to call me and have me come up and grease her car for them and change tires or wash it or polish it. See, she got to know me pretty good and she knew what kind of a worker I was. I graduated out of high school in 1933, and that is when the United Mine Workers came in here in Carbon County. They used to hold their meetings out in the cedars. We used to go out in the cedars and hold our meetings there. I helped. I was in with the United Mine Workers, and we used to go down t o Price . They had cops and deputy sheriffs and every- thing then. I'm telling you, you couldn't move. We were trying to organize the mine up there in Kennilworth, and finally we got it organized. I paid fifty cents to join the United Mine Workers . That is all it cost me. So, I tried to get a job all the fall of 1933, and they wouldn't give me a job until finally one day...oh, during that fall of 1933 was it? Yes, I didn't try to get on at the mine. I went to school in Salt Lake as a radio engineer. I took up radio engineering at a trade school in Salt Lake. One year of it, and I passed my exam. I take it back, in about 1933 the first of the year in January, it was, they gave me a mob up there. I was drying sand on the tipple for the shop. The sand was for
9

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
the mine, but I was drying sand for the mine.
NT: What was it used for, tamping?
EM: No, the sand, to put underneath the locomotives, on the
wheels, so they could get traction, so they wouldn't
slide on the rails, see.
NT: Where did they put it? All along the rails?
EM: No, they had a tie that went down on the front of the
wheel on each wheel, the two front wheels. You pulled a
lever like that, and the sand fell down onto the rail. NT: That is because the grade is so steep down there?
Yes. The grade was so seep and they couldn't make it and that. So, I worked four days in January and four days in February. One of them was an idle day and they laid me off.
EM:
NT:
EM:
NT: Oh, so, this was January of 1934?
EM: Yes, January 1934.
NT: Okay.
EM: That is when my dad sent me to school. I made those few
Is that when you joined the United Mine Workers?
I joined the United Mine workers before that in 1933.
dollars, so I decided to go to school in Salt Lake. I only went in there, I think it was only about six months , and I got my license. Then I carne back, and I got a job down here working for KOAL. They called it KEUB now, isn't it?
10

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
NT: No it is still KOAL.
EM: No, it was called KERUB then.
NT: Oh, it was?
EM Yes, and then they changed the name of it to KOAL after
that, about four or five years after that. I was getting
seventy-five dollars a month.
NT: Pretty good in those day.
EM: For working there, but then the mine foreman's wife up
there, she called me and she says, "Corne up to the house . George wants to see you." So I went up to the house, and he says, "I need a timekeeper real bad. Seventy-five dollars isn't enough for you to go drive back and forth. " I had to drive back and forth to the radio station and back here everyday and stay there ten hours. He says, "I need a timekeeper, and I think you can handle the job. But I want you to understand, it is not an outside job. It is in the mine , in the dispatcher's shack ." They had a dispatcher's shack there. They had a tunnel that ran a mile and a quarter long on a four percent grade, see.
NT: Yes.
EM: They used to bring the coal trips out. They used to bring
thirty cars, then they used to put friction shoes underneath. They used to put four friction shoes under- neath the front coal cars. All they would do was sand the rails and these friction shoes slowed the trip down. On
11

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
the empty track--they had a double track. On the double track they had a trolley line on the loader track that didn't have anything. They used to coast out. They didn't use mag because they didn't have mag. What I mean by mag, it is a generating. It takes the motor on the locomotive and make a generator out of it so it will slow it down, see.
NT: Yes.
EM: They didn't have that, but they put that generating
outfit on it several years later. I helped them install that. So, I worked in the mine there. I used to go all around in the mine. Go to the different places the ment worked. I used to know all of the men, what they did, and how they did it. Then we used to go into these real bad places. They used to have big timber in there. They had one place there where they called it the "big timber town." They were eighteen foot timber in there. You had to be awful careful in through there. So, they put me on night shift.
NT: Gee.
EM: Oh, yes, taking care of the time, for a while because
they had a dispatcher on days.
NT: What exactly did you do when you took care of the time?
What does that mean?
EM: You see, in those days, every coal miner had a time card.
12

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
He wrote on the time card how many hours he worked. He just put it down on the time card. Then we had the boss sign it ... no, he didn't. I did. I had the boss sign them. I would take them, and they had a time book. I used to put everything down in the time book, how many hours they worked, any overtime, and everything. It had to all be okayed by the boss. Then I used to go down to the office and turn it in at the end of the month. At the end of the month I had to make a new time book and everything. Then I used to have to post the list on idle day work, what men worked, and stay with the bosses up there and find out what crew they wanted to work on this Saturday and how many men they wanted to work and all this and that. Finally, they shipped me outside. When they shipped me outside then I ... oh, when I was in the mine, I was going to tell you, I used to have to run and check for gas in what they call the "barn slope." One day I was in there to check for the gas, and I carne back about nine o'clock at night. This Bill Jackson, that is this here George Jackson's brother, he was "driver boss" they called them in those days. He says, "Where the heck have you been?" I says, "I have been out checking for the gas." "Who in the hell told you to do that. You are not supposed to be doing that. You are just supposed to stay there." Just then the voice got on the phone, and he says, "I told him
13

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
to do that. I am the boss around here, and I want you to understand that it is none of your business what I do. You leave my tank people along." [laughter]
NT: That was George Jackson?
EM: That was George Jackson, yes. He used to listen on the
phone all of the time. That phone would ring, and he had it down in his house. He had that phone right in his house, and he would listen all of the time.
NT: Yes. So, you were talking with Bill from the office? EM: No, from in the mine.
NT: Oh, I see.
EM: He told me.
NT: I bet he did.
EM: He still doesn't like me too good, but what could I do?
NT : EM:
he was the boss.
Yes. That is true. [laughter]
So, after that I was time keeping, then they put me outside. When they put me outside, if they needed any men, I had to run downtown and call the men out to work. Finally, they got it so that I stayed in the office. I worked in the office. I worked in the office until noon. Then at noon I got up, and I went into the mine and checked the mine again. Finally, I got tired of it. I didn't like it. I didn't like that. There was a war coming up then. That is in 1940 when the war just
14

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
NT: EM:
started, so I went and asked Jackson for a job in the mine as a mechanic. He says, "Oh, no, we can't do that." So, I quit there and went to Sunnyside and worked in Sunnyside for the Utah Fuel Company. That is when Kaiser first bought the Sunnyside mines, but they didn't buy this number two mine. I worked there, and I stayed in a boardinghouse over there. Then they wanted me to become a foreman in the shop, a shop foreman. Finally, Jackson got hold of me again, and he says, "Hell, you better come back to Kennilworth. We will give you a job in Kennil- worth as an outside boss there." So, they gave me a job as an outside boss in Kennilworth. I stayed in Sunnyside
for about two months.
You did?
When I went to Kennilworth again, I went in the shop. They put me in the shop there, and I worked there as an electrical boss is what I was. I was the same over at Sunnyside. But over in Sunnyside I was down in the mine all of the time. I wasn't in the shop. But, in Kennil- worth I was in the shop. Finally, I didn't like that. You didn't like being in the shop?
No, boss. I didn't like being a boss.
Oh.
I asked them if I couldn't go in the mine as a mechanic, and he said, , "You are not going to 1ike. You a in' t going
NT: EM: NT: EM:
15

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
to do this and you ain't going to do that." So, they put me in the mine on graveyard. So I went in the mine on graveyard as a mechanic and worked on the shovels and 7- A-U. They had 7-A.U cutting machines in those days. I worked t here. Finally , one day I was in the mine. Jackson was promoted from the mine foreman to the superintendent of the mine.
NT: George Jackson?
EM: Yes. And he seen me in the mine and says...we were
working overtime this one night, and we had a shuttle down and we had to get it out because they never had no spare shuttle or nothing. So he says, "What the hell are you doi ng in here?" I says, "I am working. Why?" "I don't want you to work in here. I want you--"
END OF SIDE ONE
"I want you to go outside and become an armature winder. We need one real bad. We are going to need one real bad. There is a war coming up and we don't know what we are going to do ."
NT: And you were just too smart to be in the mine.
EM: Yes. I says, "But, I don't know a damn thing about running that. "I don't give a damn if you do or not. You can learn. " He says , "You have got to see Paynor . " He was the master mechanic and tell him that I said to put you
on ." So I went out and seen Paynor , and says , "I would
16

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982 like to come in here and learn this armature winding you create . George sent me out." He says , "Just because you wound one little armature, that is no sign you are an armature winder." I says, "Paynor, I have never seen an armature." He says, "Oh, I will think about it." So, I went back in the mine. It was about a week later. Pretty soon here comes Jackson again. He met me at the mantrap. He says, "What the hell you doing in here." I says, "I am working." He says, "Didn't I tell you not to go out in that shop?" I says, "Yes." "What did Paynor tell you?" I says, "He is thinking about it." "Thinking about it?" He took his hat off and he threw it down and he jumped on i t . He says , "I am the superintendent now around here , and what I say goes. Now, you go back out there and tell him to put you on, that I said so, and I will see that son-of-a-gun." When I went back out, I went out there, you know, and I told Paynor." He says , "Okay . Bring your tools out tomorrow when you come to work." You see, in those days, we had to buy all of our tools. They never furnished you no tools , no nothing. You didn ' t get nothing. You had to buy everything.
NT: And you had to buy it at the store, right?
EM: No. You didn't have to buy it at the store. They didn't
force us that part. But see, all of the time that I was up there as a timekeeper, they had an electrical engineer
17

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
there. He was a graduate of Boston Tech. His name was Slim Bowman. He took a liking to me, and he used to ask me different electrical questions. Then, he says one day when I was working in the mines for him , "You little sun-of-a-gun, I am going to make an electrician out of you if it is the last damn think I do. Just like that." So I went out in the shop and I started to wind arma- tures. I wound armatures clear up into 1949.
NT: What is an armature?
EM: An armature is the rotor that is in an electric motor
that turns around. There are two kinds. There is a De- armature and there is an AC-motor. The AC-motor hasn't got an armature in it. It has got a rotor, they call it. It acts on the same principle. On an AC-motor it what they call a three-phase-AC. The voltages that we worked with in Kennilworth was 250-volts-AC, 2200-volts-AC. The DC-motors that I worked on up there, they were 120-volts- DC and the 250-volts-DC that was on the main locomotives. They were big ones and it would just take a little while to wind one of them .
NT: How long would it take?
EM: The big one used to take me about, it took about three to
four days . NT: Gee .
EM: Then, see, because you had to band it. You know what I 18

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
mean to band? They had steel wire. They had wire that you put on the outside of it to hold the cornice down so the centrifugal force wouldn't put them out of the rotor. In the meantime, they had another mine up around Vegan, but Aroncos had another mine right around the canyon from Kennilworth. They made some kind of an agreement with Kennilworth to bring a few of there motors there to have them remodeled because it was almost impossible in those days to find anybody that wound motors. You didn't have no big outfits in Salt Lake, only General Electric and Westinghouse and Silver Electric. But they weren't too big and they didn't give a dang. They took their time and they couldn't wait in those mines. They couldn't wait.
NT: Yes. How did the Aroncos get their motors around to Kennilworth?
EM: On a truck.
NT: Oh, they just trucked them in?
EM: Yes, they trucked them in. They didn't have big motors
there, just little motors. They had them on water pumps and stuff like that. In those days they never had big machinery, as yet. Then the Jeffrey Loader carne in, and the Goodman Loader carne in, and they all had their own motors, different size motors and that. All of the stuff in Kennilworth was DC. Very, very little AC. Then they sent me over to Wattis during the War there to wind a
19

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
motor for the Wattis mine on the tram there for a
generator.
NT: Who sent you?
EM: NT: EM; NT: EM:
NT: EM: NT:
The company. It was Bennett Coal and Coke.
They were a different company from Wattis weren't they? Oh, yes, but they asked, and so they sent me over there. I see.
I went over there for about a week. That was sure some deal over there on Wattis. You had to ride on a rail. Really?
To get into the mine, you mean?
To come out from the top of the mountain down to the tipple. They used to have little parts. You used to sit down on them. A guy would sit on one rail, and you sit on there and hold hands, then you go down. I mean you went down. After that, then Kennilworth started docking down. Right around 1947, 1948, or 1949, right in there some- where, there wasn't hardly any work. So, I went over to Sunnyside to try to get on over there, and they black- balled me there.
How come?
Because it says that they needed me in Kennilworth. They
couldn't let me go.
Oh, so Sunnyside wouldn't hire you?
Sunnyside wouldn ' t hire me. The general manager that was
NT: EM:
NT: EM:
20

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
over there, his name was John Paparakis, I knew him real well. He called me down in the office one day and said, "What the heck is the matter?" I said, "It looks like you guys don't want me here. I can't get on." He says, "No,
no, no. That is not the idea. They blackballed you from Kennilworth. They don't want you over there. They says, "To hell with them. We need good men here too, so you go report to the master mechanic. " So I went and reported to the master mechanic and they put me on. You see, I was an electrician too. I used to do a lot of electrical work. Gosh, I repaired hoists and motor generator sets and transformer hookups and big power lines. I used to do all
of that. In fact, I had a very dangerous job.
NT: Sounds like it, working around all of that voltage.
EM: I learned that. I got hold of the 250 in Kennilworth.
That fixed me. It knocked ... it was during a rain storm and I put a piece of canvas over my head, and I run up the tracks and hit the trolley wire and the trolley wire knocked me down. The power knocked me down in the middle of the track into the water.
NT: Oh, no.
EM: Yes. And my mouth full of copper. After that I was awful
careful what I did. I says, "No, no, you are never going
to make that mistake again."
NT: How old were you when that happened? What year was it?

NT:
Oh, that was about 1945 , somewhere in there . In the meantime, I was in Kennilworth. I forgot to tell you this. This is a very important part of my bringing-up. They had an explosion in the mine.
When was that?
In 1940-something--1945 or 1943. I don ' t know when it was . It killed seven men.
Oh, no.
It killed my neighbor and a bunch more men. I was on the ..     don't know if I was the timekeeper or not. No, I wasn ' t the timekeeper. They brought them out to the hospital and those four guys were just jumping down going, "Oh, oh, oh, oh," burning and burning.
Oh.

Inside?
Yes, inside of them. They were burnt clear down, and the doctor was there. Dr. Robinson says, "Emanuel , I don ' t do a thing for them. They are all going to die. They are burnt clear down into their lungs. There is nothing, nothing to save them."
Oh, no.
There were about four of them there. Four or five of them had died there .
Did it take very long for them to die?

EM: NT: EM:
No. It took a couple of days.
Oh, gee, how awful.
That was awful. So, they says, "We got to do something about this explosion." See, a cable came out of the machine. They used to run a cable to the machine, a 150- volts to run the machine. Some way or another it fit up against the rib and the cable broke and it arced and set the explosion.
Oh, yes.
So, they called this fellow and had this electrical engineer come from Kennecott Copper.
Oh, really?
Yes, they used to come in there and did different things
for them during the mine, you know.
Who was he?
Leonard Wilson. He showed them a lot of the different ways of doing things and getting things going. He designed what they call the Kennilworth Cable.
Oh.
It was a cable, and I got in on the experiments on that. What it was, it was a regular cable and it had a wire mesh all on the outside of it that was covered over with rubber, see. That wire mesh would dig right down onto the cables and would go back and kick a little relay out and there would be no power. You could take an ax and cut

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
that cable in two without a flash NT Gee
EM You could stretch it and it would do the same thing We conducted all of the experiments right there on the shop floor I know I had to laugh at this Leonard Wilson I used to help him I was helping him there and that He told t his Paynor, the master mechanic, he said , "You know, this boy here , (I was just a little fellow , not too old then ) he is sure a good little electrician He sure knows his electronics " This master mechanic said, "Hum " That is all he said See, he was jealous because I knew a little more about radio One day he called me in the office and he says, "So, you know quite a bit about radio engineering?" I says, "Yeah " He says, "Answer this question," of do something I can't remember what it was. So, I figured it out and give it go him He says, "It didn't take you very long " I says, "No It ain't that hard " [laughter]
NT Did he ever come to like you? EM Who is that?
NT The master mechanic?
EM Yes,hedid
NT That is good.
EM Yes, he liked me after that But he wasn't the master
mechanic when I quit Kennilworth There was another 24

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
fellow in there that was a master mechanic NT Who was that.
EM I can't remember his name He was from Colorado I know that. He was from Colorado He was a mechanical engineer, and he was from Colorado Bernhart, that was his name So I got the job at Kayser He says, "You go in the mine I have got to have some trolley line put in the mine and outside here " We had to put a trolley line in He says, "It is pull work There is a lot of pull work we got to do and there is a couple of transformer stations we have got to get fixed " So I went to work with this George Harmon I don't know if you know him with Harmon Electric
NT Yes
EM George Harmon and Mike Bruno NTá Yes.
EM NT EM
Is it Mike Bruno?
There are a lot of Brunos
Yes, Bruno I know his last name was Bruno but I can't remember it wasn't Mike Bruno Maybe it was too Anyway, George and Bruno were very good friends So the three of us, we went into the mine We put these here we had to take and hammer these here steel pins up into the roof Then we screwed on the insulators and that
for the trolley wire It took us quite a while there. Our
25

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
boss up there, his name was Lee Alder He was Lee Alder The master mechanic was Lee Alder. One day we was outside and something happened Something happened when we was outside, and he caught us the next day and he come in the mine in the tunnel where we was working and he give us hell for being outside there on the cement I says, "That wasn't our fault We had to go down there and fix that trolley line that broke What do you want to do, leave it there?" "No " "Okay " So we was there standing and he says, "My God I want you guys to ---?--- " So he was there, so I told him, "Hey, get off that care We have got work to do in here We can't be here talking to you "
NT Oh, no.
EM And George Harmon, he says afterwards, "Boy, you sure
told him I would be scared to tell him that " I says, "Why It was the truth, and he couldn't do nothing about that " So, I sure got a bang out of that Then he put me . it was about a month-and-a-half in the mine there on that Then the next month he says to me, "You better go in the shop and start winding motors." And he had two more armature winders in there There were three of us armature winders That is how many motors we had This one guy's name was Avery He was the one that was working up in Kennilworth when I was too He got mad and quit
Kennilworth because they put me in the shop
26

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
NT Oh, really.
EM He says to me, he told me, "Emanuel, I am not going to
show you a dang thin I learned it the hard way and you can learn it the hard way too " I says, "I don't want you to show me anything I will get it " But this other Slim Bowman, he come along, and he told me what books to buy and what to read up on. Then after that, Bowman quit, and another guy came by the name of Dick Madiken He come from Newfoundland.
NT Gee
EM: Boy, he was a smart electrical too So he used me to do

NT EM
NT EM
his electrical work down on the tipples when the tipples were down or that
And was that all at Sunnyside?
No, that was in Kennilworth
Isee
I forgot about this other deal. Because this Avery, he sure poured it in to me
It sounds like it
Then he become a boss in there and he set me down on the tipple. "Go fix it down on the tipple," he says
Down at Kennilworth?
Yes "Go get that fixed, and let's get it fixed right away "
NT. Laugh.
27

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 1 1 , 1 9 8 2
EM So I went down there and I told him when I went down there and worked there for a half-hour, I said, "I don't know too much about that or nothing, but I think I got it going all right." Then there was another guy up there named, Tom--I can't remember his last name He come up there and he walked up to Avery and he says, , "You dirty sun-of-a-gun, taking a kid like that and sending him down there on the tipple greens like that and not showing him anything " He says [to me], "Next time, kid, you go down on that tipple, you let me know and I will go down there and help you," because he was an electrician too He says, "We don't have to take that from you " He says,
"Listen, Avery, if you don't like it, you meet me down on the store porch tonight and I will beat the hell clear out of you "
NT (Laughter) .
EM Just like that
NT Hee, hee
EM Yes, but I sure was tickled out of that
NT I am surprised you could talk to the bosses that way
EM Oh, yes Tom Wilkinson, his name was Wilky, we used to
call him, Wilkinson here
NT How did Avery react when you showed up at Sunnyside?
EM He didn't like it I was up there and they had this one
kid His name was Hicks His dad used to be superinten-

dent of Horse Canyon, and he was learning it, but he didn't know too much. He was learning, and he was winding a motor there I walked over, and I was looking at it, and he says, "I can't get the wires down in this moor " I looked up and says, "I guess you can't All of the wired that you have got in that coil, they are not the same size."
Oh, no wonder.
So, he says, "Oh, yeah, yeah " I says, "Yeah, you have got to get the right size down in there " Sherman, his name was, Sherman Hicks He was an Ex-marine
Gee.
So, I was there for about a month, and this Alder come in the shop there, and he says to the guys in there, "I want .we have got too much material in here Too much material is in the warehouse We don't really need it. I want you to use all of that up, then and everything that you use we will order after that We will order it new " And he turned around and says, "Manuel, I want you to do the ordering."
Good for you.
And, Avery, he didn't like that He didn't like that. He walked by and says, "What do you know about it?" I says,
"More than you do."
(Laughter) .
NT EM
NT
29

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982

I says, "I got the job didn't I?" So just before that he told Sherman in the mine there we had everything that was all the motors. See, all the motors in Sunnyside there at that time were two-twenty and they were changing them all over to four-forty volt motors So that means that you had to go one thing about Sunnyside, they had all AC motors You had to change a connection on them to make it four-forty, see?
Yes
So, he sent Sherman down in the mine to change a motor over and pretty soon Sherman come out, and he says, "I can't change it over." He says, "What, you can't change that over? It is just a simple little wire It is the star circuit Anybody can do that. Emanuel, you go down there with him and change it over " So I went down there, and in five minutes had it changed over I come back up and he met us again up on top there and he says, "Haven't you guys gone down in the mine?" I says, "Yeah, I got it running " "You got it running You mean to tell me you go it running that quick?" I says , "Sure , there is nothing to it That is what you said "
Oh, dear (laughter)
So, that is the way it went, see, until then I was winding motors in the shop all of the time. Then if they had any kind of electrical trouble down in the
NT EM
NT EM
30

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982

NT ---?---
EM Not only that, on the outside, if they had any trouble at
the substations, the fans wouldn't work and the power lines were down in the tipple or something down on it, I used to have to go down even on the tipple and fix the tipple.
NT Gee
EM Besides doing my winding.
NT Did you get paid overtime?
EM No It didn't run into overtime NTá Oh, it didn't?
EM
NT EM NT EM
It was just during the day It was just routing work for me It didn't bother me Then we put in the new substa- tion. Of course, they had an outside firm do that Then they had electricians in there that done it too
When was that put in?
What, the substations?
Yes The new one.
The new one? It was in, let's see, about 1960, somewhere right around 1960. He used to ..but, that is what they
31

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
used to do to me. I used to work in the water and the dust and everything wondering and hook up all these here machines Then we had an electrician working in the shop there We had another two or three electricians His name was Maxfield He is the big boss for Utah Power & Light over here in Vernal now
NT Oh, yes
EM Yes He used to work. they just got in what they called
a long wall, the new long walls they had They got one from England You see, this John Paparakis was a colonel or something in the Unites States Army over in Germany during the war, and he was in charge, in the rural district, he was in charge of all of the coal mining there.
NT Gee , how interesting

number three mine When they had electrical trouble on i t , Maxfield was the only one that would go down there He wouldn't show me the prints. He wouldn't say nothing They used to bring the panel boards out and they used to work on them and that They wouldn ' t show me the prints or nothi ng They used to keep hushy-hush , to be a big shot. He got it in for me because they got trouble with the hoist up there, and he couldn't fix it It wouldn't run, so the master mechanic, the shop mechanic whose name was Bill Lindsey, he says, "Emanuel, go over there and fix that hoist He has been over there too godang long We can't wait like that " So, I went over there and in five minutes I had it going I went over there and Bill and Maxfield says, "Did you get that hoist fixed " I said, "Yes, it's running all right now, Bill." And Maxfield says to him, "Well, what did you do?" Bill Lindsay told him, "It is none of your damn business You are supposed to know " [laughter]
NT Oh, gee
EM He wouldn't tell him
NT Did you ever get to work on the long wall?
EM Yes This Maxfield left there, so one day the long wall
went down He says to me, "Emanuel, go down there and see what is the matter with that long wall " I said, "But I don't know nothing about it, Bill Never worked on it

EM That is all it was. So I fixed that in nothing flat And
he says, Lindsey told me when he come down to the shop, "That didn't take you too long How come you could fix that so easy?" I said, "I don't know Just lucky I
guess." But see, they had that long wall down in there, and then the coal was so low there that you had to walk stooped-over. What I mean, not five feet, I mean a mile
NT Oh,no.
EM Oh, yes Half a mile , mile , mile-and-a-half not mile-
and-a-half, but about a mile at the most The only other way that you could get around there, they used to have carts They used to be operated by batteries, motors, and they used to sit down in them, and they used to take you around
NT Yes
EM But, on the long wall that is all there was to it I went
36

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
down there this here Frank Markershek, he was one of t he big bosses there , and they had the long wall went down on them, and, boy, they were up against it because they had to have the coal I went down in there and checked it out, and it was grounded They were scared One guy says, "You can't run it that way " I told him, "You go over there and mind your business, and we will see how we can run it " So, I went there and I sucked some of the water out of it and that brought it down quite a bit I said, "I have got enough resistance " I knew I just about had enough power there that it wouldn't blow it I put it in there, and we run it there for a while and let the cover off and drained it out, and that son-of-a-gun worked fine He thought that was something Then, after that, that wasn't so bad We got that long wall going Then they got another long wall in from Germany There was something haywire with it They couldn't make it work They had one smart guy up there He worked for Don in Moab, there He was a smart electri- cal engineer, he said He says it wouldn't work and all this and that and couldn't get it going So, this superintendent of the mine told me, he said , "Emanuel , I want you to go in tomorrow--Saturday it was I didn ' t even know I was going to go in the mine That is what they used to do to me
37

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
NT Gee.
EM He says, "Go in there and see if you can fix that " So,
I went in there and I worked on it I fixed it, and it was running good, and I left So, Monday when I came there, this chief electrician says, "That godang thing that you fixed won't even run You don't even know what you were doing. It wouldn't even work It is not running now " I said, "Well, gosh, it is sure funny " So, that night when the mechanic and electrician that worked on that there come out, I asked him--I can't remember his name, Bill or something like that I says, "How did that long wall work?" "Fine, Emanuel, it never worked it really works swell " [pause] He is a Greek too
NT Doesn't surprise me
MM [woman's voice] He is my brother's boy, and we adopted
him NT Oh
EM So, he says to me, "Why, Emanuel, that run good What did you do to it?" I said, "Listen, you guys will never learn That is Stevee [Hi from Stevee] I says, "You guys will never learn When you have got electrical equipment, you have got the electricity to take care of, but you have also got the mechanical end If you don't have the mechanical end working right, the electrical end won't work right " That is all I told them Boy, this one
38

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
big boss, he come to me and he said, "Boy, you sure showed me I am sure glad of that " After that we got, it wasn't about a year or so, that is the new machines that they got now It is a long wall that comes from England again. See, these others were four-forty volt See, all of the motors we had in the mine up there at Kaiser were all four-forty volts All their AC motors were all four- forty except on the hoists and fans and that I was going to tell you about another thing on the fan On our fans up there we have a D-slope motor hooked on to them, but it doesn't run until the fan motor stops Then, the diesel starts up automatically and turns the fan, see, to make the mine safe for the men in the mine I had to troubleshoot that thing too
NTá Gee
EM I am telling you, that was .they used to get me going
because that was all electrically hooked up We had one, two, three, four diesel motors What I mean, they were as long as that couch
NT Gee
EM They were about six feet high. So we got them going
NT So, you stayed out at Sunnyside until you retired?
EM Yes Then they got long wall in from England, a new one,
a thousand volt NT Gee.
39

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
EM A thousand volt long wall So, they brought it up there They set it up there. Lindsay and the foreman come there and they says, "Emanuel, you got to go in the mine and hook up that long wall." I says, "Gee, Bill, I don't know a damn thing about it I don't know what it is all about." He said, "I don't care You are going to go in there and hook it up You are the only man we got out here that can hook it up If you don't understand anything on them just call up West Virginia, talk to them on the phone. The electrical engineer is down there. " So, I called up West Virginia on the phone, and I talked to the electrical engineer down there for about fifteen, twenty minutes Just as soon as he started talking to me and explaining these things to me, I knew right away what it was It was just like the Kennilworth cable
NT: That is good.
EM See
NT Yes
EM That is, a similar system So, I went in the mine, and I
hooked it up, but we had trouble with one relay there Then the electrician by the name of Avery and I, we both figured what was the matter They had the coil hooked backwards on it
NT Oh, no wonder.
EM So, it wouldn't close that one relay, but we got that
40

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
going. What else was I going to say? There was something there Then we started it up, but it wouldn't run at all It would run, but it would kick off. It kept kicking off It didn't have enough power, see So I went and I checked the power So I went out and told the boss , "You haven ' t got enough power in the mine to run it "
Nt Oh
EM: We had forty-one sixty , (4 , 160) volts coming down into
the mine on a four-up cable It went down so far down to where the entry was From the entry back into where this l ong wall was , was a mile-and-a-half back in there I went there, and I took my meter and I checked the vol tage , and I only had thirty-eight hundred volts I told Bill, "Your haven't got enough power " Then the master mechanic from in the mine here, he come around there and he says, "Emanuel, what is the matter with it?"
I says, "You haven't got enough voltage down here You have got to get more voltage " He says, "How do you know you ain't got on voltage down here?" I said, "I checked it from the meter " He said, "You are crazy checking that with a meter " I says to him, "Now, listen, Patten, you just shut up because you don't know what the score is I have checked it as high as forty thousand with the meter, and nothing happened to me You have got to know what you are doing Forty-one sixty (4,160) that isn't nothing."
41

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
He says, "Well, you're crazy." He wouldn't side in with
me that we needed power NT Huh
EM No, that wasn't it The next day it stopped and it wouldn ' t run While I was there , here comes John. He says , "Emanuel , what the hell is the matter with this outfit?" I said, "John, you ain't got no power, and I can't tell any of your bosses anything that I need more power They won't get me any more power" He said, , "You tell me what you need " I said, "We need more cable " He says, "Okay, we will have it here tomorrow morning " So, he called up New Mexico or something down there They had the cable, and they strung the cable and put it in and away the machines took off and have been working ever since
NT Gee.
EM Not one of t hem come and told me, "Emanuel, you know what
you were doing "
NT They probably just had trouble admitting it
EM Yes , they didn't want to admit it . This one boss that was
out in the shop, I can't remember his name it has been so long He says, "I want you to meet my wife She is coming in tomorrow, and she wants to talk to you because of all of your electronic and electrical experience " She is an electronic expert for the Bell telephone company or some

Not heart trouble. I had an enlarged heart . no, blood pressure, was it? Oh, a murmur in the heart or something, but it is gone now
That is lucky.
Yes That is gone My scout master had the same thing, and he stayed there with me On the other side, on top of Timpanogos, there is a glacier You slide down on that on your pants. There is a lake down there, and they call that Emerald Lake right at the bottom of that glacier That sounds lovely
The way Timpanogos got its name, there was an Indian Maiden Her name was Uganogos She had a lover called Timpanak There was another Indian there, and he went after her too, see So, what they had to do to win her hand , they had to race around Utah Lake , and racing around Utah Lake Timpanak got killed They waylaid him These other Indians waylaid him

NT Sure
MM I said, "You can check it in my bank So, if you really
want to sent me, you have to do it on your own because I don't really want to go back I have my husband here By the way, I don't speak too good English, but I know the laws here. What am I going to do with my children, two babies? And don't forget, I am an American Citizen " Oh, I hated that "Oh, yes, that is right Oh, no we can't kick them out of their country, no way " I said, "I don't think you would " In fact, my landlord told me when we went to Canada, "Leave your kids with you mother because they might make you stay longer there when you have your kids If you don't have your children with you they can't stop the mother to come back soon, you know "
EM Yes, we had to go to Vancouver

55

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
don't want your husband "
END OF SIDE ONE
I had to go to another room They said, "By the way, where is your husband?" I said, "He is sitting in the hall in that other room I asked you is you wanted him to come in " They said, "No, we want twenty-five dollars You have to pay for that visa " I said, "Oh, you just want the money, huh " In a way I was kind of sad
NT I could see why That doesn't really sound right
MM The only thing they wanted to know is how many kids I had You had to have their birth certificate They won't
believe nothing you tell them They had everything down What boat we come here, the ship, everything, everything We can't tell them If we tried to tell them a lie, you know, we probably would be in trouble I mean, there wasn't anything to tell them, to talk about
NT Yes, that is right What did your father die of?
MM He had sugar diabetes for about five years, I guess He lift in 1939, and we were ready to come here, but the war started, so we stayed there He never knew what happened
to us He heard everybody was getting killed, you know
That make him really worried and everything NT Oh, sure
MM He had sugar diabetes and he never went to the doctor because he thought, "Well, my wife and kids are probably
56

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
all dead, so why I have to take care of myself, and God is going to help me, you know " So, finally, he wasn't able to see He went to an eye specialist, and he told me to go see his doctor because he can give him no glasses He said, "There is something wrong with you " And he went and he was really bad with sugar diabetes When they brought him here, he moved from Pennsylvania to Price
NT When did he move to Price?
MM In 1947 He just lived here for about six months Maybe,
1945 because he died in March. Six months that would make
it what? He came here in 1946, and then he died in 1947 EM And her brother got here just as he said, didn't he?
MM Yes, my brother came here because if he stay in Greece
for his birthday, they would take him in the army My father, he passed away, and my mother went to talk to the ---?--- down there. She told them, "If I leave him here alone, he is just going to be with no parents to take care of him What kind of a fellow are you going to have, so why don't you let him go, and whenever you want him, I send him back 11
NT Tell them that
MM So, he came at four o'clock in the morning My father was
in the private hospital here, and he was waiting all night long He told the nurses and the doctors, "My son is coming No way are you going to stop me not to see him
57

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
when he comes here " He went in and saw him The first words he said is, "How is your mother?" He started crying and everything. He said, "We will see you later on, Dad, It was good to see you. Take care of yourself " He said,
"The first thing in the morning I want you to take me " We had friends here and he went over and mother went over to their house and stayed Before ten o'clock, the minute he sat there he said, "I don't feel too good Give me a glass of water " They give him a class of water and he said, "You better take me to the hospital I don't feel too good By the time he take him the hospital So it was about four or five hours my brother saw him.
NT Oh, that is a shame, but at least your brother got to see him
MM Yes, but he got so sick himself, you know
NT After all of those years.
MM Yes, it had been years, and then four hours later for him
to die, it was terrible.
NTá And then your brother had to tell your mother and you
That would be hard too
MM. We she something happened because he wasn't in New York
to be there She had a first cousin, or something, there What happened, when we went to the ship, to go from Athens to New York, this fellow from her village, we went up in the deck to sit down. She met him there and said,
58

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
"How are you doing," and all that He said, "I am all right How is your husband " She says, "Fine " She said, "He sent me money and every thing, but I had to have
clothes for my kid and it wasn't quite enough so he sent me the tickets and everything That is sure funny " She said, "Why " "Because they already have his funeral down in Greece." "Oh, no" And she started screaming, "Stop the ship." You know, and he was hollering to him. It was about four or five hours away. All of the young fellows from our town and everything, they thought they were going to go pick him up or something saying like that He said, "You better and go and tell that lady a different story because she is going to die and she has got four kids." There was three of us in the ship They went in the army and the other ones here He said, "That is not fair. You shouldn't say a thing like that to her " So everybody, they told us if he was dead they won't let you come, so just think of it that way So, they just kind of turned things around When he landed in New York her cousin comes and says, "Where is my husband " He said,
"He is supposed to go to California because this bishop dies " She said, "That bishop was dead before the war. What are you trying to tell me? Why don't you come right out and tell me my husband is dead " She says, "No, he is not " We had a little idea, but we wasn't sure After
59

 EMANUAL MAY MAY 11, 1982
