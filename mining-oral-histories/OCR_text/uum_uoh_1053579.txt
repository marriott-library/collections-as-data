We would like to start off first by thanking you for permitting
us to come and talk to you this afternoon. Would you start off first by giving us a little bit of your background, how you started with the A.E.C.?
Well, I got out of the University of Minnesota in 1940, and that,
of course, was a pretty good time for a man looking for a job, but like so many people of that time, I kind of got caught up, so I spent about the next five years in the Marine Corps. And when I came back from there, I went back to the University for a quarter and found myself in South America in a diamond prospecting situation down out of Venezuela where I spent a little better than a year. That was-- found plenty of diamonds but the economics there were quite different than many places where you produce diamonds. Costs are more compar- ~le to the costs 6f the United States for extraction of deposits,
whereas in South Africa and other major diamond places, you get a lot less cost, perhaps a ratio of ten to one. I came back and
worked for about a year in the lead-zinc mines out of Coeur D'Lenes and then I went with U.S. Steel. I was in Venezuela for another couple of years down at . . . well, first I was associated with pretty much raw exploration in the various out-lying districts. And about the last half of that job I spent on which now turned out to be a pretty good deposit, like about a half billion tons of
iron ore, perhaps more. That's what we could calculate then. I

 T:
came back to the States. Marine Corps had a pretty good hold
on me yet. But it looked like it'd be a little while off, so
I was offered a job here, and I thought this would be just dandy. And I stayed here until about 1961 and I went to Las Vegas in the testing organization. I worked a variety of places there: Alaska,
Island, Valen, Nevada, Hattiesburg, Mississippi; Carlsbad, and some out at Mercury, and then I came back here last year.
What did you do in the testing organization?
My main part of the business I guess you could say was underground construction. I was associated with drilling of first the exploratory holes to determine the nature of the media where you wanted to put
a test. These were small normal drill holes that one would drill
oil patch of probably eight, nine inch diameter holes. After you determined the lithology and hydrology was satisfactory for the purposes for which the test was concerned, you probably offset there and drilled large diameter holes. Most of the holes on the test site were about seventy-two inches in diameter. And these were cased to an I.D. of forth-eight inches. These were down as deep
as four thousand feet, some of them deeper. The deepest, I think,
I was associated with there was about five thousand feet. And some of these holes we would then install a mine plant, that is just regular guides with a head crank and a hoist and go down there and cut out the casing, excavate a cavity, and then line it again, so that it was completely water tight. This was a real interesting

pressures. And that's about what we did in Alaska, too, ess ent ially , except the holes were bigger and deeper. We drilled first two
holes were ninety inches and they were cased with a fifty-four i n ch I.D. The last one we were working on was a hundred and twenty
inches. This was to go to essentially five thousand feet. So it's from my association with that part of the A.E.C. I think you can see has been underground construction. To drill holes and mine plants. And of course, at Valen it was a little bit different. We sank a shaft there. This had to do with the Valley Uniform Program which
is. a matter of detecting--ah--most of these atomic devices, should
we say, Russia decided to try to sneak one off. The reason we were at Valen specifically is because it was in an active nuclear area
and that particular program was designed to differentiate the seismic signal as created by an earthquake and which, of course, has some dimensions. Whereas, explosion of a nuclear device there, it's more or less point detonation. Now my particular business there was sink- ing the shaft and exploratory drilling and this type of general con- struction. But I understand that the area of scientific groups,
that they did have a pretty good success. That is, the scientific aspect in differentiating the signature on the seismographs between those two. One at Carlsbad was. interesting too. I only work there after the shock. My problem was to represent the A.E.C. as we drove
pressures up t o about nine of a faul t in your water of water in under those

the tunnel back into the cavity created by the explosion. That was--we had a lot of problems with radioactivity. Every hole you'd drill or shoot, you'd probe em, sniff em to see how much radioactivity you would be getting. There are lots of different facets of this business. Real headaches. A lot of them very interesting.
In what capacity are you serving the Atomic Energy Connnission at this time?
B:
T: Right now I'm in the ore research section. I'm primarily concerned with the collection of data or the calculations of ore search. I
also put together the statistics on the periodic drilling, this
being a good key to how much activity is going on. We keep track of the drilling done by industry on a monthly basis, this just being a convenient time because they generally get their invoices on a monthly basis. But the meaningful information we get out of that drilling,
we put on an annual basis. But this is not the end point. This is merely a means of determining who is developing ore and then we attempt to--and with pretty good success I might say--to get the
results of the drilling from

erty. If it's grouped in such a manner that you can't tell who it belongs to, you know it's in this state of this formation. But you have to do it this way because--to maintain the confidence of industry that we are not giving out the information which is
the company, the raw data. Whereas we calculations, and .these are grouped so organizations can identify their prop-
page 4

 T:
privileged to us, you get quite a response for these total
figures. The figures are very necessary for planning several
years or decades ahead. Somebobody is going to put in a power plant with the capital expenditures necessary for these things would have to have some as.surance of raw material. And so, a
lot of people in the industry look at these figures that we put
out on an annual bas.is.. Have you seen these little blue books
that we put out, by any chancef This is about--this is the main function of the program right now. It is vastly different than when I came here in the early fifties. Considerably different.
We were at that time trying to encourage anybody and everybody
to find any uranium that they could. We had bonus programs. We constructed a number of miles of access roads. I worked on that program. Somehow these figures of mileages and millions of dollars of expenditures and the detai.ls escape me--it wouldn't be very
hard to find out if you're interested because the files are over at Bedrock. There's a real mark of change from what we're doing now and what we did and I th.ink pi:uobably it's more impressive to me having been gone essentially ten years when this transition actually occurred.
What was your function when you first came to the A.E.C.?
Well, about the time I came here they started the Circular Six Program which was the bonus program. As you may have heard from your other conversations., you had to certify the applications
th.at were submitted by the va,rious miners. Circular Six was based
G:

 T:
upon a production. In other words, if you were certified--your property--and you produced from i_t, depending on the amount of production and the grade of production, it depended on how much bonus you could get. I believe, if memory serves me, you could
get up to thirty-five thous:and dollars worth. of bonuses. if you
had the maximum grade or better and you had all the tonnage avail- able under the program. So, I. worked on that for quite s.ome time. Let's see, I was here for about s:ix months, then I was detached at
a one-man office down in Monti.cello, Utah, for about a year and a half. And I came back here again and I worked on that Bonus Pro- gram here pretty much th.rough the end. And I worked on the Access Road Program for a couple three years. About that ti.me we had more uranium than we knew what to do with., so instead of all these in- centive prograw.s, we had to work on allotment programs where you limited to some degree the amount of ore that the government would purchase. So you can see how the pendulum swings. We had all these incentive programs. and then when the market glutted as it was, you'd have to parcel it out. But everybody gets a little share of the market. About that ti.me I left. Went off.
What did you do in Monticello?
Well, that was put there because at that time not too many of these outlying districts, you see--Grants had just--oh--I read about Paddy Martinez when I was in South America and his discovery in the Dillworth down in Grants. But Wy-oming hadn't come in in any significance to speak of. And the main production and the main
B:

 T: effort was being extended right on the Colorado Plateau. We had a one-man office at Monticello, and we had a one-man office over at Marysvale, Utah, oáver in that particular mining district. Those people were over there because it was more convenient for people to come in to chat with a representative of the Commission concerning how do you apply for the bonuses and what's the market
going to be, and various little problems that they had. At that stage of the game we accepted certain samples and did a certain amount of assaying to determine,'Do you have any ore or don't you'?
We also did a lot of mine evaluation and as best you could to attempt to determine the production capabilities. Because a man--just like any other mineral industry--you bring in a small hand specimen
as a representative. That's fine, but in many instances they just pick off the nicest piece. That's human nature. So, if you have a piece of ore thich runs real nice on an assay, now how representative is that of the deposit? If it is a representative piece, then fine, you can put some credulence into the prospect. But if he goes up there and he can't find another piece like it, then you'd better suppress your evaluation of what you might expect to get. But it
was a matter of convenience for certain of the local people, and also it eliminated a lot of crap. Those--those offices were not maintained too long. I think I was down there about--oh, about a year and a half. When I left, they thought that they could probably travel out of here, because the importance of some of those areas
was being suppressed as the Grants deposits were coming in about this time. Shortly after that the strikes in Wyoming came up also. This

 T:
was considered to be centrally located enough. We had a lot of field camps at that time too. These were trailer camps. You can probably talk to the boys over th.ere. They were scattered pretty
wide. I can't rememben :,where they were, all of them. I know they had one in Monticello, they had one up at Elk Ridge, one in White Canyon, one in Monument V alley, up in Dry V alley. These were located in areas of interest or activity so that they could try to figure out how much you might expect out of there and also there were drilling programs being conducted out there. The government actually drilled on certain places to see if they couldn't find something to augment these areas, because any way you could find uranium at that time, was considered the only way to go.
I have a question dealing with that. How did government exploration and drilling compare with private industries' exploration and drill- ing?
Well, I'm not going to be able to give you a real straight forward answer on that tor this reason; a large portion of the government's drilling was done on withdrawn lands. Part of those deposits which
were discovered were leased and mined. But part of those deposits
are still there. Right now the government is not putting out what they have left because of the leas.ing program rather than--my under- standing--and this will be up to any individual interested in bidding on this--to arrive at his. own ore estimate. So, to compare the success ratio of the government drilling with industry--oh, I can't
B:
T:
page 8

 T: give you an answer, partly for the reason I just explained and partly because I don't know. If you look in that blue book back in those days, the only drilling done is quite insignificant compared to say the 1969 drilling of thirty million feet.
B: How about the intensity of~or--yeah--the intensity of the explorations? Did the government do as much exploration and drilling as say private industry is doing today?
T: Oh gracious no. Oh, gracious no! Nowheres near, because as I say, last year alone industry drilled thirty million feet. In
the Calendar year '68 it was just shy of twenty-four million feet. Look at that little book. Back in those days there wasn't anything like this. I mean it was more on the order of a combined effort
of everybody you might say. Then, of course, we have to realize that the more ob:viouás places were being drilled then, because you
were drilling back of the outcrops, this is relatively shallow. Today, certainly, people are drilling in excess of three thousand feet. In those days if you drilled a hundred feet or two hundred feet this was c9nsidered very deep because naturally the deeper you go the more expensive your entry is, the access to the deposit and to mine it. These things all add up, so you take the cheapest one to get at and the most obvious.
The philosophies of how and where uranium occurred was being developed and still is today. At that particular time, in the real early fifties, the two main horizons of interest were salt washes and
pg9

 T:
base of Chinle, which in those days they called Shinarump and that is part of the Base of Chinle although they, geologists, have recognized that there are other divisions in Base of Chinle,
which are--you'll find they are not specifically Shinarump, but they were working from the obvious. outcrops mostly. You didn't see a great amount of line drilling, shall we say, like you find
in Wyoming. We know the formation is. down there. It should be interesting so you just start up the collar on complete barren ground but you do have some good reasons to figure. Whereas many times down in the Shinarump you might get an outcrop so you try to drill the channel. If you had a nice outcrop on the rims of the
Morrison, you just proceeded back from the rims in stages. So--but to give you an answer-on that specific question, I don't have one.
Maybe somebody does. But, oh--having been gone from this place
for about ten years working on sáomething quite unrelated, a lot of little things which I might have had in mind then just kind of got away. I don't think I ever did have an answer to that. Maybe some-
body does.
Ah, you mentioned that you worked on the Access Road Program. I was wondering, what did you do when you worked in that program?
Well, the first thing we had to try to as.certain was, did we have a source for the uranium ores. in an area where the existing roads were not very satisfactory for hauling the ore to the mills? So, if this
was not a common situation--so if you could justify the actual amount of reserves or a reasonable potential based upon geological
G:
T:
page 10

 T: criteria--that you felt that expenditures of the monies, which that particular road might cost, just depended on the terrain
and the distance and the type of road that you would have to have. You were building a road through the desert, that was one thing and in some of this canyon country, the cost per mile would go up quite a few dollars. So the basis of it was the quantity of ore versus the cost of the road. How much could you get? You had to have some justification and a pretty good justification. This was
actually going to be money well spent. I think that in those days the philosophy was that this was a very critical material for national defense. So, if you felt you could justify the expenditures of these funds, then you did. Most of the roads--we didn't build
the roads ourselves. The funds were obtained through the A.E.C. from congress and sometimes the roads, depending on the magnitude,
were built by Forest account, which is kind of cost plus proposition, through the Bureau of Public Roads or the State Highway Departments. Or if on the major roads., like on the improvement of the road from Whitewater down here, we call it Grand Junction down through the Uravan Mineral Belt, and this was actually contracted out through
the Bureau of Public Roads to private contractors. So there was a variety of ways in which these things were contracted depending on the size of the project, or how much of an improvement you need. Th.is, of course, the need, was strictly the amount of ore you ex- pected to be hauling over that particular segment.
G: Did any of the roads, in the end, did any of the roads help pay for themselves., or prove necessary?
pg 11

 T: Oh, I'm sure that you could probably find a few which, looking
at it from hindsight, may not have been the best place to put roads. I think in most instances, and again, to give you a real precise answer on that, I think I would have to go and review
all the statistics as to where the roads are, how much it would-á cost--we paid to build these roads, and then try to say how much ore came out over those things. But to pick out an individual road and say that we exercised very poor judgement, offhand I
can't come up with one. If I looked at the figures, maybe I
could. As I say, these things have got away from me after twelve, fourteen years. I don't have the details too well in hand. Certainly they were-there were varying degrees of usage, should
we say pounds of uranium per dollar spent, I'm sure you would have a fairly wide spread in a comparison like this.
G: Were you ever involved in any ore sampling when you were working on the Circular Six Program?
T: No. Ah, do you mean--well, let me ask this. Do you mean in the sampling plants?
G: Well, in general, just the ore sampling--trying to determine the value and grade of the ore?
T: Oh, yes. I think all of us were. We worked on evaluations. It was quite common that you had a place that you could scan it with counters and in those days practically everybody carried counters.
page 12

 T:
So, I cut quite a numbe r of samples in various propertáes .
About that time we had a laboratory where we routinely ran those
things. So, from the view of t rying t o evaluate a property, it was quite common that you cut s.amples, or scanned it, or prefer-
ably, a combination of both. But this was a fairly routine thing.
Earlier, before the interview we discussed equilibrium. I wi sh once again you would give us your definition of this problem.
Well, again on the equilibr:tum, I: feel th.ere are people more knowledgeable right here in the building who you could get a much better answer from than from me. I would prefer that--well--gentle- men, why sell out for something less than the best. I would suggest you check with Gene Grutt and have one of his people discuss this with you. I can give you a general one, but let's go to the best one we've got.
Okay. I have one question. I don't know if you'á11 be able to
answer this or not--it's my understanding that in mining, ventilation and fans have been in us.e for many, many years. Why did it take
so long for the A.E.C. or the government in general to specify that uranium mines be ventilated?
I think that mine safety is more of a p1rovince of the Bureau of
Mines than it would be the A.E.C. Historically, I think this is
proven. Just last evening on the ten o'clock news there was a
little discussion on the laxity of government in safety regulations
in coal mines. Now I¥áve seen mines shut down by state mine inspectors.
G:

 T: This, of course, is a function of how many men can any agency
field with the allocation they're getting, in all the various aspects. True, normal operating procedure in mines., historically, they have to have ventilation. This- becomes readily apparent if
you go into some of those little old diggings which are inadequately ventilated. There were many of those old holes. which I inspected.
I always lit a cigarette and it better puff free and easy or I didn't stay there. This. is one method. If you have a shortage of oxygen your cigarette doesn't burn very good. Other people use candles.
It better burn. If the flame s.;tarts diminishing and dies, you
getter git. But again, I think I would refer you to the expert. Have you talked to Stan Meyers yet? Well, I would leave that to him then. He is a speci.alist.
B: We got a full technical definition of radon daughters.
T: Oh, I'm sure that you have lots of good information then and far better than I feel I could.
G: Do you have anything?
B: I have nothing.
T: Real fine, gentlemen. I hope I have given you something. I have no idea of what you might expect from me, but that's about it.
G: Okay, thank you."
