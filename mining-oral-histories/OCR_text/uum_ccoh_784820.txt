 INTERVIEW OF ANNA TOLICH. JULY 23, 1993. INTERVIEWED BY MADGE TOMSIC. TODAY IS JULY 23, 1993. WE ARE AT THE WESTERN MINING AND RAILROAD MUSEUM IN HELPER, UTAH AND THIS IS MADGE TOMSIC.
I WILL BE INTERVIEWING ANNA TOLICH.
MT: Anna, what we are trying to do is get the experience of the people early on in Carbon County, but I am going to take you back to the very beginning. When were you born? I was born October the 6th 1907.
AT: MT: AT:
MT: AT:
MT:
AT:
And where were you born?
I was born in Slovenia. The capitol of Ljubljana. But it
was a village by the called, called by Sodrazica.
So it is just outside of Ljubljana?
We would be about 125 miles, like from here to Salt Lake,
the distance.
What were the main things that people did in that village
for a living? What did they do? Was it a coal mining
area?
No, they didn't have any industry really. It was mostly
their own farming. You know. They would have their own
piece of ground, you know, and raise their own
vegetables, you know, and have animals, you know, and
l
dairy sort of. And sometimes, some of them would .. . It was mostly horse and buggy, you know, wagons. There was no cars at that time.
So what did they have to sell to make money?
Well, there wasn't much to sell, you know. Cause seems like every one had a piece of ground, and you know, had their own animals, their own vegetables to grow, you
MT:
AT:

 ANNA TOLICH
know, on their land. And maybe some of the men might have done some small labor for one of the neighbors, and maybe got paid a little bit. But there wasn't any industry there at all.
So they didn't work any place but on their farm? And they were pretty self-sufficient.
Yea, yea, yea. That's how it was.
See, that is pretty important information because these people were getting prepared to come to the United States, weren't they. Where they had pretty much the same situation even though they were to come here to work in the coal mine. So tell me about your family there. How many children were there in your family?
We had eleven in the family.
Eleven children?
Six girls and five boys. And I am the baby of the family, and I am the only one living at present time of the eleven children.
MT:
AT: MT:
AT: MT: AT:
MT:
And how did your parents support such a large family? How
would they take care of such a large family there?
AT: I... it is hard to have an answer for that. People struggled them days, you know. And with their own growing, you know, their vegetables, you know, and their own animals, you know, for like chickens, you know and dairy, you know, and porkies, you know. It seems like
2

 ANNA TOLICH
they survived.
MT: AT: MT: AT:
MT: AT:
MT:
AT:
They made all of their own hams and sausages?
Yea, we had that, and we..
What else did you put away for the winter?
Well, they always had a crop of good, you know, potatoes, you know, and then they would have cabbage, make sauerkraut, and of course the porkies, you know, they would smoke the meat you know, and make the kielbasa sausage. And uh ..
So you had things stored away for the winter?
Yea it was kind of preparation for everybody. And there was no machinery, you know, so they had to do most of it by hand. There was no tractors or anything that would help them. They had to do it by hand. Hoeing, you know, and plowing. Horses, of course they had horses.
So vixen did... when did your family decide to come to America? Or did your parents come over here.
My sister, Mary Gornick, first name Mary.... She came as a teenager to her cousin to Sunnyside, Utah. That's up in East Carbon now they call it. And then my father came 1912. Well they heard there was jobs in America, you know, and he thought that he would try it, you know. And so he earned some money while he was working. He worked at the Sunnyside Tipple. When the trip, the mine cars would come out of the mine, he would dump the coal down
3

 ANNA TOLICH
the chute to the cars, box cars, you know, down. And then he would load the car, and then the next time the trip would come up, that's what he would do. He worked at the tipple.
MT: He would dump it into the train.
AT: Train, yea. It was the railroad, you know, cars.
MT: Now he came over in 1912.
AT: 12. And my sister, Mary Gornick, came with one of her
cousins in 1904 or 1905.
MT: Oh, so you had a sister over here before you were born
actually?
AT: Yea. Yea. I was born in 1907.
MT: And the rest of the family stayed there.
AT:
MT: AT:
MT: AT: MT:
AT:
Well, my sister Rosie came to our relative to Cleveland, Ohio. We had relatives. So she came there very young. And then she got a job and then she met this nice gentleman and married. And that was in Cleveland, Ohio.
And then when did you come over?
I came 1913 with my mother and three of us daughters,
girls.
So you were about six.
I was five.
Five. And now that's five of the children. What happened to the others? Did they come here?
Well, the brothers, they passed away much younger, you
4

 ANNA T O L I C H
know, and I never did get to meet them, you know. But through correspondence my youngest brother, Mike, he and myself were corresponding for years, you know, back and forth. We never seen each other, or met each other. And he had.... must of had an accident at an early age. And at that time they didn't have medication, you know, and things that would stop infection. And so he lived until he was about 21, then his heart gave out. But he used to use a cane to get around, you know.
MT: And did he stay, at the...
AT: He stayed in Europe. When my parents were here and three
of us girls, you know, when we traveled with my mother, he stayed with my sister, Louise. And she took care of him.
MT: So they stayed pretty much on your family's place there? AT: Yes, yes. And then, 1920 my parents and my sister, Tona,
who is two years older than me, went with my parents back to Europe, cause we had our home there, you know, some land. But for myself, I just really didn't care to go at that time. I had made friends here, went to school and I was happy. And then my brother-in-law and my sister, Francis, said "Well, Anna, if you don't want to .. if you don't care to go, in a few years we will go back and then you can go along with us." So that's how I stayed.
MT: So you stayed with your sister. And your parents went 5

 ANNA TOLICH
back. And did they stay there?
AT: They stayed there, yes, they stayed.
MT: What was their reasons for going back?
AT: Well, I had my brother, who I mentioned, you know, Mike.
And they wanted to go back and see him. And then we had our home there and we had some land, quite a bit of land. And they just decided maybe that would be the best thing to do, you know. And then I had my sister, Louise, who take, took care of my brother, you know, while they were here. And just.... sort of a decision, you know.
MT: So how many of your family ended up staying here? Y ourself, and how many sisters?
AT: And two sisters, Mary Gornick, she married a Gornick, and then my sister Francis Bond. Of course my sister Rosie, she was in Cleveland, Ohio, you know. She never did come to Utah.
MT: You are the only one still living. But you were the youngest one.
AT: I was the baby of the family, and I am the only one living.
MT: And how old are you today Anna.
AT: I am 85. Young. Don't forget that.
MT: I agree. I agree . I don' t believe all the wonderful
things you do at 85, running around like that.
AT: October is coming real fast. I'll have another birthday.

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Do you remember your trip over here?
AT: Like from Europe over to USA?
MT: Yea.
AT: Vaguely, you know.
MT: Now you came in.... tell me again, in 1913?
AT: In August .
MT: Of1913.
AT: A long time ago.
MT: You came on the boat.
AT: On the boat. And I think it took us a dozen days, you
know 12 or 13 days. And I briefly remember the ocean, you know. And we just went on and on, and wondered when we were going to hit the land, you know. For us children, you know, younger ones, you know, we would ask questions, you know.
MT: Did they have food on the boat to sell to the people? AT: Yes, they did. And then it depends what class you went . You could go first class, then you go second class, and
third class. And... MT: How did travel?
AT: We traveled third class. There wasn't money, you know, for first class and all that. There just wasn't money. MT: That's why I asked about the food for the third class.
AT: It was ... it was eatable . You know, I mean, we got along. MT: But you didn't go into the dining rooms or anything like
7

 ANNA TOLICH that.
AT: Not much, because there wasn't money, you know. And of course, there were people on the boat that were always very kind, you know. They were always, if they had something, you know, extra, or... Anyway, they offered, you know.
MT: Now. When you got to America, what did you have to do? AT: Well, when we came to New York; we had to be examined,
you know, checked out for our health. Our eyes, our throat, and if we had vaccination. I think I still got a marking on my arm. Vaccination. They looked you over. If there was anything serious, you know, you would be sent back to the country you came from. But we managed it. We were all quite healthy. And then we, uh, from New York, we traveled to Cleveland, Ohio, cause I had my sister Rosie there. And I had relatives, and I had an uncle, and they had a store with clothing, you know. They had quite a few businesses. But anyway, the clothing store he had, he dressed us up in American clothes. Oh, we were so happy and proud.
MT: How nice.
AT: We even had the hats, Panama Hats, you know, that turn up
and they had that band around and streamers down. And we
were big shots. MT: Oh wow. Great.

 ANNA TOLICH
in Sunnyside. Which the name is Zupancic and they shortened it to Zupon. And he took us there to that lady and she was very, very helpful, very kind. And her husband had an accident in the mine or something, so he lost his eyesight. And so when we came there, the lady wanted to prepare some lunch for us, you know. She says, you're tired. And my mother wanted to be polite. She didn't think we should, you know, impose on this nice lady. And us girls, I still remember, we were tugging my
mother's dress or skirt. We said "we are hungry." And my mother wanted us to hush, you know. So the lady, of course, mother thanked her and she says no. And so she walked down with us down to the lower Sunnyside. And when we got down there by Mrs. Plute. Do you remember the Plute girls from Price, Zelpha, Jenny, Mitzie Smolich? Do you remember M itzie Smolich?
MT: You know the Plutes, my husband's grandmother I think was a Plute.
AT: They had relatives. They had a relative. In fact there was a young fellow in Sunnyside who was related. He was a cousin to the Plutes. And yea, they had relatives, cause I remember. In fact I even seen him, you know, met him. But anyway, we got down there, and of course we didn ' t know Grandma Plute, you know, we didn't know. But my dad was there. And of course they told us that my
10

 ANNA TOLICH
sister Mary and my brother-in-law went down Price, you know to wait for the train. And they said you just wait here, they will be corning any time. It was horse and buggy, it took quite a time. So, anyway, Mrs. Plute was so kind. You know, and everything, took care of us.
MT: And they all spoke your language.
AT: Yea, they all spoke our language, yea. Of course, they
understood some, and some could speak a little in English, you know. They had kind of been long enough, you know, in USA that they could kind of.
MT: Now Anna, what was your maiden name?
AT: Marolt. M-a-r-o-1-t. Marolt.
MT: And they didn't change that? It wasn't changed.
AT: No, it wasn't changed.
MT: It wasn't like Zupan.
AT: No, no, Zupan, see they shortened it. It was Zuponchich.
And my mother's maiden was Pacic . And, of course, it goes back to history as I speak, keep speaking. My grandfather, Patach, Patish, he was a senator of Austria. Cause we had the King Franz Joseph at that time when I was born. And he was the senator of Austria at that time. And when he passed away, they had military services for him. Of course, I wouldn't know, you know.
MT: Your grandfather.
AT: My grandfather on my mother's side. He was dad's father
11

 ANNA TOLICH
or dad of my mother, Pakiz.
MT: Now when you left what is now Yugoslavia, and is now breaking up, but it was under Austrian rule when you left?
AT: Yea it was. Yea. And like I say we were under the king. But people what I hear and what they were speaking, he treated people very well, gave them their opportunities, you know. And they were very happy with him there. Like so many kings you know, that people wasn't comfortable or didn't have the freedom, but I understood that he was very understanding.
MT: Well it didn't change until after the Second World War. It must not have been too bad. I just wanted to ask you something about your home in Europe before we move on to
your home here. Where did you go to school, you know,
what kind of a school did they have?
AT: They had school there, but I didn't, I was too young. I
was only five . So when I came to Sunnyside, that was the
first time I entered school.
MT: And did they have just one church in the village.
AT: They had the one church and one school.
MT: And were they primarily Catholic?
AT: Yes, mostly, yes, yes. That was a Catholic area.
MT: Did your brothers and sisters go to school over there? AT: Yea they did. Teta Bond (Aunt Bond) my sister Francis
12

 ANNA TOLICH
that lived here in Spring Glen, she went to school. She was 14 when we came here. And my sister Tona, went to school. She was two years older than me. See, I was only five.
MT: Did they have a pretty.... a school supported by the government?
AT: Yea, it was supported by the government, you know. And everybody, it was a must to go to school. And then the girls had to learn some handwork besides their, you know, arithmetic, you know, and spelling. You know, they have to learn hand work. And my sister...
MT: You mean how to sew...
AT: Sew, or crochet, or knit, or embroidery. They had to
learn.
MT: They taught that right at school?
AT: Uh huh, right at school. And my sister, Francis, she got
high marks on her handwork, crochet. And she was terrific when she came here. Any pattern you world have, she just took a couple of glances to figure out how it goes.
MT: That's incredible. So your brothers and the rest of your family who stayed over there, they remained farmers, they stayed right there on the farm. Did any of them ever go into the city and work?
AT: Well, my brothers, I think, whatever happened, illnesses or something, they passed away at quite a early age.
13

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: AT :
And you didn't ever see them again.
I never saw them again. And I never saw my parents again, cause they went back 1920 with my sister Tona, and like I mentioned before, I didn't care to go. And they left for back for Europe, you know, in 1920. And I stayed here
with my sister and Brother-In-Law. So the last time I saw my parents was when I was 12. See I was in Cleveland, Ohio staying with my sister, Rosie, for a while, and they had a son by the name of Stanley who lost his life in War Two. He was in college, age 21. Stanley was his name. I used to babysit. And so my mother wrote and said and Annica, if you don't care to go to Europe with us, come back to Sunnyside and you can stay with your sister Francis, and your uncle . .. your brother-in-law Joe Bond." So that's what I did. I came by train all alone when I was 12, from Cleveland, Ohio .
And you didn't see your parents ever again.
Never again.
Well they must have been fairly old though, weren't they, if you are the youngest .
Well, I think dad was about 59, and mother was some years younger when they went to Europe. They were healthy at that time, you know.
So how many years did they live?
They lived, uh, well, I was married in 1924. And so when
14
MT: AT: MT:
AT:
MT: AT:

 ANNA TOLICH
I had my wedding pictures developed, I sent them back over there. So that maybe was... maybe was 2 or 3 weeks after the wedding by the time the pictures were done. We
MT:
AT:
MT: AT: MT: AT:
had a photographer and when my pictures arrived through the mail, there was a funeral going on for my dad. He never got to see even the pictures, you know, of my marriage .
So he didn't live too long after they went back. So when did your Mother die .
She died later. She died later in about 1979, or something like that .
Oh, she lived until 1979?
Yea, she was, she was quite an age.
Oh, that's interesting.
And she uh, I think it was mostly broken heart thing, war too. In War Two they bombed our town, they bombed the school, they bombed our home, they bombed the village. So our home was destroyed. So the board of education, or the district asked my mother would she donate that piece of ground. They wanted to build a school. So they built a twelfth grade school. And when I went there, I was there twice, I went through the school and seen it. And it has got twelve grades going on .
When did you go back?
I went back, what was it, 1980, something like that . 15
MT: AT:

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: So that was after your mother had died.
AT: Yea, yea. And then the second time, I took my daughter,
Stanna Ann, the baby daughter of mine, she went with me. And then my son-in-law Ed Evitz and my daughter, Eleanor went on their own also over there. And then Ed went to the village where his parents came from, so they got to see it all. So of course in fact I got a letter today from Dalmacia. That's the other side, you know. They don't have a conflict right there. But it is more in Zagreb and Dubrovnic. But of course I have been in all those places. But I got a letter today and she says that most of the younger fellows, you know, were called in the service, you know .
MT: Well, the Slovenians aren't in the war right now.
AT: No, no. My relative from Ljubljana where we stayed,
Stanna and I stayed there when we went there, she wrote and said they don't have any turmoil there. She said it ' s on the other side. But she said they come here, they have no place to go. Everything was destroyed that they owned. So, we are trying to help them. But, she said they're so many. But, we are trying to help them. Good people.
MT: Yea, that is really sad. Well, Anna, lets come back to Sunnyside, when you first came there.
AT: Good old Sunnyside. You know I drive occasionally up there. I used to drive every year. And I would drive to
16

 ANNA TOLICH
the end of the town. That's where we lived, that's so- and-so lived, that's where the school was, cause we moved in different places, you know. And, uh... so its quite' ..... .
MT: So what mine did your dad work at up there?
AT: He didn't work in the mine, he just worked in the tipple,
like I say. When the coal came with what they called the trip, coal trip, it came out of the mine, he dumped the coal down into the cars, railroad cars.
MT: Was that at sunnyside?
AT: Sunnyside, yes. He never did work in a coal mine.
MT: Not inside.
AT: He worked for Mr. Naylor.
MT: That name is familiar.
AT: Yea, Naylor.
MT: And what did you do? Did you start to school over there? AT: I started school in Sunnyside for the first time. I was
only five.
MT: Okay. In 1913 did they have a lot of houses built, did
they still have tents around?
AT: Well, they had some houses built, but some of them had,
you know, little cabins, and different, you know... The first place that we moved into when we came to Sunnyside was some Greek people. And of course, no fault of their own, they just had a little kind of cabin. And they said,
17

 ANNA TOLICH
well, its not much, but if we'd like to live there, you know, we could rent it, and then later on we could maybe find a better place. Which we did. So... I still remember, the roof was leaking so bad we had to put pots and pans to catch the rain. But, I mean it was one of them things. And then later on we got a better place to, you know, live and we moved, you know. But whenever we moved, we always scrubbed the place so the next person that moved in, they would find it clean. That was our teaching. My mother was very, very strict that way, you know. Like, for instance, if there was a needle on the floor, and we seen it, she wanted us to pick it up, you know. She didn't want us to waste anything, and not have disrespect for anybody. And help each other. There were people that were ill, you know, and my mother was quite a... she wasn't a registered nurse, but she was quite a kind and helpful person, you know. So if there was any illness, she went right over and wondered if there was something she could do. And she taught us girls also.
MT: And I guess that's how some people made it through those years. Anna, I wanted to ask you about all the things that your family raised in Europe, did they then when they came here, did they get pigs and animals and plant gardens? Did they do that?
AT: Over here? Yes, yes, yes we did. We didn't have a cow, 18

 ANNA TOLICH
like dairy. But we had porkies and we had chickens, you know... and I think we had some... And one time we had a group of rabbits, and they multiply so much, you know. And it was kind of a nuisance. And so we just kind of, we stopped that. But we did have a garden, you know, some lettuce, you know. Not a big garden. We usually bought potatoes and some different things from some of the farmers below Sunnyside. Peczuhs . .. you know the Peczuh's, their grandparents... they had a farm down there. In fact, their sister, or the Peczuh's daughter, she was one of my best friends, you know.
MT: Where did they come from?
AT:
I, uh, I think they came from Czechoslovakia or someplace there, you know. They weren't really Slovenian, you know. So over that way. But he could speak quite a bit, you know, of different, you know, caught on, you know, of different nationalities in the town. So he kind of caught on to the languages. So it seems like we made a... you know, helping each other.
So you spent most of your time going to school when you were a young girl . Did you have to work hard around your home?
MT:
AT: Yea, we did. We had to do our duty to help mother. Of course , I was quite young . My sister Tona was two years older . And Francis was , you know, fourteen, so they were
19

 ANNA TOLICH
like dairy. But we had porkies and we had chickens, you know... and I think we had some... And one time we had a group of rabbits, and they multiply so much, you know.
And it was kind of a nuisance. And so we just kind of, we stopped that. But we did have a garden, you know, some lettuce, you know. Not a big garden.

So you spent most of your time going to school when you were a young girl. Did you have to work hard around your home?
MT:
AT: Yea, we did. We had to do our duty to help mother. Of course, I was quite young. My sister Tona was two years older. And Francis was, you know, fourteen, so they were
19

 ANNA TOLICH
taking the heavier chores, but yea, we had responsibilities. We had a wash board. There was no washer.
MT: So you had your experience on the wash board.
AT: And when I went to school, I still remember, for the first time, and the teacher gave me the book, and I learned how to read, "Mary and John played the ball, 11 and
so on, and I came home. I was so excited, and said to my mother, "I know how to read, 11 and I would read, you know, like nothing. You know, when you are young, you catch on. Not because I was smart, but ...
MT: Oh my goodness. I think that's incredible. Now how did you learn the language. How did you learn to speak English?
AT: Well, in school, and then friends, you know. They'd tell me you say this this way. And if I said it wrong, they would correct me. And I tried, I suppose.
MT: And so basically you learned it from your peers, from the other children.
AT: Yea, yea, and then going to school, you know. That gave me, you know ...
MT: Did they give you special attention, did you feel, when you went to school?
AT: Yea, I think they were very kind and thoughtful, you know, knowing that I came from a foreign country, that I
20

 ANNA TOLICH
didn't know the language, my parents didn't know the language. But you know, they are catching on.
MT: Did your parents learn to speak English?
AT: Well, some, some. My mother even sang "Let me call you
sweetheart." You know, she didn't know the words too well, but she tried. And you know with her hands, in Slovenian a little bit, this and that, so she... people understood what she meant.
MT: Now, how long did you go to school in Sunnyside?
AT: Till the sixth grade. And then I was promoted to the seventh. And a group of us in Sunnyside Schools, we went
down Price for spelling bee. We were top spellers. And for time tables and different things, you know. We were very active.
MT: So, you traveled then to Price to school?
AT: No, no. It was in Sunnyside. Price... We went for the
MT:
AT:
contests. All the camps.
In junior high, in seventh grade, where did you go to school?
I didn't go to the seventh, you see. I went to the sixth grade, promoted to the seventh. And I was married when I was sixteen, I was quite young. And, see, I missed some of the school because when we came from Europe, I had couple of colds, and I was kind of petite. And there was many times my mother didn't send me to school because,
21

 ANNA TOLICH
you know, I was kind of frail, more of a frail child. I wasn't really sick, but I was kind of petite, you know, I just wasn't that strong, you know, like my sisters. And then I was married when I was sixteen. And then, I was over 60 when I got my high school diploma.
MT: We are going to get to that. Now you were married to Mr. Tolich?
AT: Yea, John Tolich, Ivan Tolich.
MT: At sixteen?
AT: Uh, huh.
MT: And did you stay out in Sunnyside then?
AT: We stayed for a couple of years. And after the Castle
Gate mine explosion, we moved to Castle Gate.
MT: So you were married in 1924. And that was on March 8,
that explosion.
AT: Yea, yea. But our...
MT: When were you married in 1924? What year. . . or what
month?
AT: January. We were married in January, 1924. And the
explosion was in March. And our men, my brother-in-law and my husband went up to Castle Gate when they heard about the explosion. And they didn't want us women to go, you know. They went .
MT : They went there to help.
AT: They went there to see what they could do. But it was

very sad situation, you know. When they came back home, you know, up in Sunnyside, they couldn't even speak, you know. They were so emotionally moved by the tragic thing. Women, mothers, daughters, sisters, you know, children, were crying. It was sad.
So many were orphaned.
It was 173 that lost their lives. And they needed timber men. They wanted timber men to get the mine in order. So they called up the office in Sunnyside. Mr. Parmley, Dave Parmley was the boss, one of the bosses. And he said to my brother-in-law, and my husband John, they said, would you like to go to. . . to move to Castle Gate. The superintendent from up there called and they needed timber men to get the mine in order if they want to start working. So we moved up to Castle Gate.
Now who was the man? Parmley?
Yea, Dave Parmley.
Parmeley.
Parmley, yea Parmley.
That's right. P-A-R-M-L-E-Y. You are doing wonderfully, Anna. This is so interesting. I am really enjoying it. All right. So you moved up to Castle Gate. Now, this would be in 1924. What was the town of Castle Gate like when you moved up there?
AT: Well, it seems like after the sadness, gradually people, 23

 ANNA TOLICH
you know, got a hold of themselves and started living again, you know. Bringing up their families, you know. Now T illie Y elonich, we got acquainted with her mother about the first time when we moved up there. And of course the men, when they went up to see, you know, about the explosion, they got to meet a lot of these Slav people, you know. And there was Mrs. Sluga, you know. And Tillie was very young, you know, just a teenager. And Nusich, a Nusich, Joe Nusich and his. . . Their mother passed away quite young I guess. And they were left, you know, kind of orphaned. And their dad was working in the mine, and one of the brothers. And we got to meet quite a few Slav people. Well, not only Slovenian, there were Italians and Greeks, you know. We got along with everybody. And they, you know, and then women took in boarders. You know they hired more men to work in the mine, you know.
MT: Did your mother ever take in any boarders?
AT: Yes, she did. We had boarders since I can remember.
MT: Is that right. And how did that work in your family? Did
they live at your house?
AT: Yes, they did. They had one room and they had beds in
there, you know, that's where they stayed. They were quite courteous, you know, as far as, we didn't have a lot of bedrooms. Like I say, there was not a bathroom
24

 ANNA TOLICH
indoors, there was the outdoor house. But, it seems like everybody got along and respected, you know, each other's privacy. And, uh, of course they always enjoyed the home cooked meals. So the fellows were very anxious to be, you know, asked if they would like to, you know, board there, they could. And so, you know there is home made soup, you know and noodles, and sauerkraut, and Sarma, and polenta.
MT: Now tell me about this. What is sarma?
AT: Sarma is cabbage in a blanket, you know, cabbage meat. MT: Cabbage rolls?
AT: Yea, cabbage rolls, yea, and sauerkraut, you know. Yea,
Sarma.
MT: And did you make polenta?
AT: I didn't. My sister, Francis, was terrific with that
Polenta.
MT: Now was that a Slovenian dish too?
AT: Polenta is sort of Italian too. Not only Slovenian, No. MT: See I thought it was just Italian. But it was also
Slovenian?
AT: Yea it caught on, you know the custom and the taste.
MT: And did you make the gravy you put on it with chicken. AT: Yea, different ways, you know, different ways, yes we
did, you know . Usually, do you know what ... MT : I have to change the battery here .

I meant to tell you when I was telling you when we got to Sunnyside, the Coke ovens were burning.
I want you to tell that story. That is something. I have heard from other people.
And my mother, she said in Slovenian she said, "This is hell, what did we come to." Because in our town we didn't have coke ovens.
All right now, tell me that again.
Well, when we arrived to Sunnyside, and like I say, the lady walked down with us, you know, us three girls and my mother. And Mrs. Plute was there, was standing there and her husband was in a wheelchair, he had a serious mine injury, so he was crippled, you know, and had to use the wheel chair for the rest of his life. And my dad was there, and my mother, you know, as we were coming down, the coke ovens were burning, you know. And we never saw anything like that, you know. And my mother said in Slovenian, "My heavens, my god, what did we come to. This is hell."
It is interesting. I have read other interviews from other people. I remember this French women said about the same thing, and she though she had come to hell.
Yea, and then they explained what this was, you know, what it is for, you know, why they, you know, have this fire. After they explained, you know, we got used to it

MT:
AT:

 ANNA TOLICH
from the beginning, you know. In our village, you know, none of that.
MT: You hadn't seen anything like that. Had you ever been to a big city before you came to America, and landed in New Y ork.
AT: Well, New York was the biggest city. And then Cleveland, Ohio where my sister was and my relatives, you know.
MT: But you hadn't travelled to any big cities in Europe before?
AT: No, no. We didn't. I know my sister Francis Teta Bond they took her to Ljubljana, she had to have some eye treatments. Her eyes were not doing so good so she had to have that. But, the rest of us, I guess we didn't have a chance until I travelled, you know.
MT: Okay. Let's go back up to Castle Gate. It was 1924 and you moved there and your parents moved over there then too.
AT: No, my parents were already in Europe.
MT: Oh that's right. They had gone back.
AT: They went 1920. And the explosion was 1924 in March. And
John and I was married in January of 1924 and we moved in
May to Castle Gate. 1924
MT: That's what I wanted to ask. Did your sister and her
husband move down.
AT: Yes. In Castle Gate. We kind of lived together. Since,
27

 ANNA TOLICH
you know, my parents went to Europe . Even though John and I we were married, you know, and we didn't live in a house by our... we always lived together, you know. There was enough room, you know, that we could .. .
MT: Did you share the kitchen and cook your meals together? AT: Yeah, we cooked. Teta Bond did most of the cooking, too. She was terrific, so we let her do the job. We liked to
eat, you know, the good stuff. But I never, I never done much cooking before I was married. But somehow I learned. And I cooked ... you know I thought my mother done it this way. And first thing, you know, little by little, I got
into the custom. You know how she did this and how she did that . So I can make Potica, I can make strudel, I can make Krapi.
MT: Now tell me what krapi is.
AT: Donuts .
MT: Now how are those... are they like the ones that we make
here?
AT: Yea, they are, they are. It is sweet bread, you know,
like patista bread dough, you know. That's what it is. MT: Then you make them in donuts and fry them in the pan? AT: Yea, in deep grease. Now a days, I usually use oil. I
care for it more. And I think it is healthier, oil than
lard . For some reason ...
MT: What other things did your sister cook and you learned to
28

 ANNA TOLICH
cook. Did you learn a lot from your sister too?
AT: Oh yes, I did. And mother, see, because I was only 12 when they went to Europe. And so I was with my sister. And of course, she had a couple of boarders, men, and...
MT: So you went on with the tradition of boarders.
AT: Yea, tradition, you know. And I helped, you know. We washed clothes on a wash board. I done a lot of washing
on a wash board. Packed water about a block or so away. You know, packed water for the next day to start washing. Oh yes.
MT: And beat on a stone.
AT: Oh, yea. And we baked bread, home baked bread. Oh, I
still remember my mother when she baked that bread. She baked it into like french loaves. And she would have a board that the men made, you know, and had the board, you know the board would have a handle and she would put the french bread on the board, and she would take an egg, and just the yolk, not the whites, not the whole egg, just the yolk, and beat it good. And then she would spread it over the french bread. And when we had the Majestic stove, it was a real heavy, that iron, you know, that heavy Majestic, but could it bake bread . Oh. And mother would take that handled board, open the oven door and
just scoot it in there, you know and that bread would come out . You could smell it f or blocks.

AT:
You're making me hungry again here Anna. But you learned to bake bread like that too.
Yea, I did. Of course I do quite a bit of loaf baking, you know, not... the more modern way, you know. But, I don't know what happened with that Majestic stove, but I am telling you it was a prize winner.
And what kinds of meat dishes did your sister cook? Well, mostly it was like soup meat, you know, and carrots, and potatoes, and vegetables, you know. And then she would make dumplings, you know, and home type noodles. Oh, yea, that was a must. We didn't go buy noodles, you know. My sister.
So the Slovenians had a lot of noodles. Would they cook them like the spaghetti, or would they cook them more in soup.
Well, mostly it would be in soup, the noodles. Mostly in soup.
.......TAPE SIDE ONE ENDS....;...
And I did want to tell you that we formed a Tambouritsa band in ...
MT: All right, now tell me that again, a Tambouritsa?
AT: Tambouritsa, the string, you know, band. Tambouritsa. You
sometimes see it on TV, Tambouritsas.
MT: What do they have in this band? What kind of instruments
are they?
30

 ANNA TOLICH
AT: Its something like a mandolin, but not a mandolin. Like
an Italian mandolin. Its not a Mandolin. I mean it has strings, you know, and its Tambouritsa . Oh, its beautiful music. Of course, I think so. But, we were about a dozen or so. Joe Myers was in it. His brother, Johnny, was in it. Zelpha Plute was in it. And Caroline Bezack Nemonich, she was in it, and myself, my husband . My brother-in-law played a big bass, you know that stands. We played by notes that time. We played by notes.
MT: So they all played the same type of string instrument. AT: Well, they was a little different like number 1 and
number 2, you know . They had different . ..
MT: Where did they get the instruments?
AT: From back East somewhere . I don't know whether itá was
made in Europe, but we got it somewhere. And our director, you know, he ordered them. Oh, I still remember the first time when we got the instruments. We were so noisy, you know, cause we didn't know how to, you know, operate them .
MT: The people didn't know how to play them when they . .. ? AT: Well, we didn't, you know, we didn't. We had heard about them. We knew what they were, but we never seen one, you know, before. And so, our director's name was Nick Bakarich. He was a Croatian. Oh, he had a sharp mind for
music , you know . Then we had another professor, director. 31

 ANNA TOLICH
He was a Czechoslovakian. Gus was his name. I'm trying to think of his last name. And he was also terrific. But Nichola Bakarich of course he was Croatian. And we played, you know, down Price theater when it was opened up. We played for that opening. And then we played up in Sunnyside for the Knights of Patsis. And we played at the amusement hall in Sunnyside for some of the dances.
MT: Now tell me, what are the Knights of Patsis?
AT: Knights of Columbus. Something like Knights of Columbus. MT: Are they catholic. Is it a catholic group?
AT: I wouldn't know what to tell you, because we had some
that were English fellows, you know. And they belonged, they were members . And my husband, and my brother-in-law , you know it was a kind of thing, you know, . you belonged to it or Oddfellows. My husband used to belong to Oddfellows at one time.
MT: So these were just basically just organizations then. AT: Yea, yea, they were.
MT: They didn't have any ethnic... They weren't all of the
same ....
AT: No the same... the same nationality, no.
MT: Or the same religion?
AT: No, just mixed, you know. Seems like nobody cared. If you
were Catholic, fine. If you were LDS, fine. If you were Presbyterian, then you know... Seems like nobody looked
32

 ANNA TOLICH
down on anybody.
MT: So it was a social organization.
AT: Yea, it was. And they had a contest one time in
Sunnyside. And Tambouritsa, we got first place. I have to
tell you that.
MT: Now, what years would this be that you were playing in
this band?
AT: 1920... Right after the strike. There was a big strike,
coal strike in '19 I think '22 was the strike. And we got together. Right after they settled, we got together, 1922.
MT: Oh so you were in this group before you even moved to
AT: Before I was even married.
MT: Oh, that's right. So do you still have that instrument? AT: I borrowed it to someone. And they... I don't think they
forgot, but they never brought it back. I should have asked for it, you know. They moved, and I never seen my instrument.
MT: So which one did you play?
AT: I played Brae Pervi, they called it, Brae number 1.
MT: You don't have... do you have any pictures of this group? AT: I have a picture. In fact it was here, a picture in one
of the windows, JCPenney. Did you see that picture where the girls were standing in front? And I'm the one with
33

 ANNA TOLICH
ringlets. And there was Zelpha Plute and Caroline Bezyack Nemonich. They had it here in one of the windows in Helper.
MT: Oh really. When did they have it there?
AT: They had it there a month or so ago. They had it there
for a long time. They probably have it somewhere again,
you know. They had a big kind of board, you know, like. MT: Oh, it was. It was done on a board. So you couldn't see
each ...
AT: Oh yea, you could see. You could see. And then the museum
here, they had some made. And I had mine made, you know, duplicate. I don't know if they still have a print here, a record.
MT: Okay, now, what does it show? Does it show you with your instruments?
AT: With our instruments and with our director Nichola Bukarich, standing on the side . He was our director .
MT: And where were you standing when they took this picture? AT: In front, in front, in front of the whole band. Right in
the front.
MT: No, but where was the band standing?
AT: It was, is was snapped... It was taken when we were up
Standardville. We played for the lodge. They christened the flag, the Croatian lodge or something, they christened the flag. So we were asked to come up to play,
34

 ANNA TOLICH
so we came from Sunnyside, all of us, up to Emil Percich. He was running that pool hall, and he was in business, you know, running that, and that's where we played. The one time that we played, but we played different places.
MT: How long did you play in this band?
AT: Well, I played for about three years, I think. And my
husband played in the one that comes next to mine, see. And Joe Myers played I played Brach Pervi, he played Brach Drugi and my husband played Bugarija, and my brother-in-law played the big bass, you know the one that stands, you know he played that. He really could play good on that bass, even though it was a bass. The soul that he made, you know he was very good at that.
AT: So this picture that you had, you gave it to the museum. MT: Ah, I have a picture of it. I should have brought it. I meant to do it, and I just didn't look for it, you know. I have it around. But the museum here had a negative that
you could have some made.
AT: Well, I've gone through all the pictures, and so far I
haven't run into it. But the thing of it is, if you will
let me take your picture, I will have a negative made. MT: Yea, yea, but I know... lets see, who was here before you
were?
AT : Francis Cunningham.
MT: Francis Cunningham. Well maybe she would know about it.
35

 ANNA TOLICH
nice buggy, wicker buggy, and she put me in the buggy and pushed me though town, so I quit crying. And of course there was no doctor in town, you know. So somehow, I guess I didn't have any broken bones. And so... And so I kind of think that when I rolled down that probably I shook all my insides, you know. And when I had my periods, starting it, oh, I had a lot of pain, right though the period, you know. And then we went into Salt Lake. . . I am trying to think of the doctor that performed the surgery on me ... before I couldn't have any children, but he corrected that, you know. So when I got my periods, I didn't have that terrific pain. And so I had Eleanor, yea, about ten years after we were married.
So you were about 26 years old.
Yea, I was ready to retire.
My goodness. That's when I got married. At 26. But, how
MT: AT: MT:
AT:
MT: AT:
many children did you have.
I had five children. We lost a little baby of pneumonia. But that year there was quite a few pneumonia cases, you know. But four living. One son and three daughters living.
But you stayed there in Castle Gate for how long?
Well, we stayed there a couple of years, then we went to Idaho for a while. I had my sister in Idaho. And then we went to California for a while, and then came back. So
37

 ANNA TOLICH
most of our lives were in Carbon County.
MT:
AT:
MT: AT:
MT: AT: MT: AT: MT:
AT:
So where did your husband work when you finally settled here in Carbon County?
Well, he worked in a mine mostly. He was a timberman. And then he was also mechanical minded. When we were in California, he took a course in auto mechanics. In fact I got the big framed diploma with a gold seal that he got, you know, when he took auto mechanics.
So what year were you in California?
Oh, I don't know, 1927 maybe. And then finally, you know, go back and forth, we came back and we just stayed here. Oh dear. Have you got a headache?
Do you have a headache?
I don't, but you must.
I don't have a headache. Do you need to take a break? Not really. I'm fine.
Okay. Well lets take you from there... This is absolutely fascinating to me. But you came back in the late '20s and settled here. What mine did he work at?
Yea, we settled here. He worked in Castle Gate, Liberty Fuel, Latuda was the last mine. He worked up Consumers, Sunnyside mine, Utah Fuel, and he never worked in Kenilworth. But he worked in Castle Gate, well, Sunnyside, Castle Gate, Consumers, and Latuda was the last mine.
38

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: And then did you buy a house in Spring Glen.
AT: We bought a piece of ground from Mrs. Lee, Josephine Lee,
she used to nurse, you know, in the hospital, if you remember. We bought . . . they had three acres, I think, and we bought an acre and a half from Mr. and Mrs. Lee. And my son lived in Kenilworth. And my daughter-in-law, Joann when they were married. And then I told them, I says well, if you would like to sometime build a home, you know, in Spring Glen, I have that ground, that land. I says you are welcome to half of it. So they decided they
would move, you know, children going to school, you know, and driving back and forth and all that. So, I deeded half of the ground to them. And so they got a nice home. Of course, our home is very small because John, my husband, wasn't feeling very well, so I didn't push on to build a bigger home and that. But what I did spend, you know, do this and do that, I could of had a bigger home. So I just didn't, you know, so our home was small. I didn't have a bathroom. I didn't have a furnace then at all. We had an outdoor house ...
MT: So when did your husband die?
AT: He died in 1951 at the age of 50.
MT: What did he die of?
AT: Well, mostly it was black lung. Yea, mostly it was black
lung.
39

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: AT:
How many years did he work in the mine?
Oh, he worked... he was quite young. When he came from Europe, he came... I think he worked for some people that had some sheep in Oregon and he worked for a while. And then... he came 1913. He came here as I did. And then he heard about Sunnyside, you know mine, they were hiring then. And that's how he came to Sunnyside.
Was your husband much older than you?
Yea, he was about 10 years older.
So you were 40 ... about 41 when he died.
Yea, I was very young. And lot of times, women, they tease me, you know. "Anna, you were so young, why didn't you get, you know, remarried?" And I say because I was .
. . I was concerned how to bring my children up, not to think of another man or marriage.
Your children were very young then.
Yea, Stanna was 2 years old. She doesn't remember her dad at all. And Delores was about nine. She vaguely... she can't remember him. But Eleanor and Vladomir, my son can. So, how did you take care of these children and raise them?
Well, my relatives have been very good to me. And I might say my friends and neighbors indeed and prayers, and my brother-in-law and my sister Teta Bond they were good.
And then later on, I did work for a while at the nursing 40
MT: AT: MT: AT:

 ANNA TOLICH
home. And then Mr. Hal Shultz he had an opening there for outreaching, so I was hired for that.
This was in the '60s?
Yea, and then I worked for him, for Mr. Shultz for a number of years . It gave me a little income, you know, to get things going. And Eleanor went to Holy Cross to study for nursing, and then she would come home and she worked for Rudy Rebol on weekends to earn a little money. And it was a kind of a push, push and go thing, you know. When I look back I just wonder, how in the world did I do it? Yea. How did you do it?
But, you know. . . You know when you are left with a family, and you do the best you can, and you don't give up. And I come from a family, we are not giving up people, you know. I always say Slovenian couragia it means Slovenian courage.
Exactly. So how old were you... You were working for Hal Shultz and you got your high school certificate.
I was over sixty. Mr. Shultz was kind enough. He let us ladies take some classes and Mary... do you know Angotti, John Angotti?
Oh, absolutely.
married, you know, that was, and she would come down to the center and give us some classes. And then we went up
MT: AT:
MT: AT:
MT:
AT:
MT:
AT: And Mary, she is married to him. And before she was
41

 ANNA TOLICH
to the college and took a few classes. Just pushing on, you know, whatever. And, uh... and I was the oldest of the group that got the high school diploma. And I really appreciate that. Mr. Shultz was really thoughtful. Good experience to work for him.
MT: By this time were most of your children grown up or did you still have young children.
AT: Well, no. Do you mean... when?
MT: When you started working for ...
AT: Yea, it was... Delores and Stanna were still home. And
Delores was doing some secretary work down the college,
and she worked for telephone office for a while.
MT: So the children had to work ...
AT: Yea, you kind of have to push on... Stanna went into
cosmetology. She graduated down at Price. And then when she moved into Salt Lake for a while then to Reno, then she got in with this real estate. She's with the Caldwell real estate. And then she works at Macy's to do a little extra. And she is buying a condo. She is buying it... It isn't bought yet, but she...
MT: Where does she live?
AT: In Reno.
MT: Oh, she lives in Reno.
AT: Also where Eleanor lives. Not with them, you know, not
now . . . She is buying a condo you know, gradually. 42

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Yea, like the rest of us. I wanted to ask you about
several of the things as your children were growing up and back in the twenties, what was your experience, say with company stores in those days, with the company store .
AT: You mean before I was married or after.
MT: Well, before and after. Did you have to deal with company
stores?
AT: Well, when we lived in Sunnyside, in fact when I wasn't
even married, you know, me and my sister and brother-in- law, we bought merchandise and different things at company store. We did that. And we had credit. We had a book, you know. But we paid our bills, I can tell you that. We were quite honest, Slovenian people.
MT: How did they do that? If you needed credit, they would give you one of those script books?
AT: Well, we had a book, yea, and they would write down what we bought, you know, and how much it cost. Then when we got a little money, we'd pay, you know.
MT: Oh, they wouldn't take it out of your check, out of . .. AT: No, they took for our rent and our lights and water, the company did that. And then we traded for some of these
private merchants like Seppi's, Larcher and Olivetos. He
had a store.
MT: All of this was at Sunnyside?
43

 ANNA TOLICH
AT: Sunnyside, yea. And then of course later, like Castle
Gate and that we had some on credit, some we paid, you
know, cash. But ...
MT: So, when you were at Castle Gate in the '20s that big
store that was robbed ...
AT: Of course that was before, you know, we came.
MT: Yea, Butch Cassidy was there in 1897 as I understand, but
was that still a company store?
AT: Yea, it was still a company store when we moved out
there.
MT: Okay, did you have to deal with them, or had all of that
changed. They didn't force that ...
AT: No they didn't push that we had to, you know. But there
was always things, there was always merchandise there that we liked and were satisfied... so we would buy it. And then the butcher shop, the meats were very, very good, you know.
MT: Do you remember who was running that store when you lived there?
AT: Marchetti's was running it at one time. Uh, lets see, wait... just a minute... who was running that store. Right off hand, I can't remember, but in Latuda Marchetti's were running the store, Ed Marchetti and his mother, you know. They were running the store. And Val Turri was running the pool hall.
44

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Right. And what about Hadianos?
AT: Well, we didn't trade with them.
MT: But they did have a store?
AT: They did have a store, but we didn't trade with them. And
we traded with Seppi's up in Latuda. They had a store,
Seppi's. And we traded with them.
MT: They are all individual stores, they weren't owned by the
company?
AT: But we did buy some. Like I say, Marchetti's was running
the company store. We traded some with them.
MT: When you lived in Castle Gate in the twenties, did they
have a company doctor?
AT: Yea, they had Dr. McDermott.
MT: And the company hired him?
AT: Yea, the company hired. And we had Dr. Bash at one time. MT: So what kind of medical did you have? Did they... lets
see, by that time you didn't even have a union yet. AT: No we didn't.
MT: So the company hired the doctor. Did you have to pay anything to the doctor?
AT: I think, I think they charged so much a month. Through your original ... your ...
MT: Oh, that you paid the company?
AT: The company, sort of, you know. The company hired the
Doctor, and then they would take so much for doctoring, 45

 ANNA TOLICH
you know, from the check, you know. Of course, I don't know how that went with surgery, cause we didn't need, you know any of that, you know, don't know how that went. Like if you needed surgery. But like the regular medical.
MT: Now when you had surgery ...
AT: Oh, that was after and we went to Salt Lake, a
specialist. I think his name was Fulmer, Dr. Fulmer.
MT: But the union had won some medical by then.
AT: Oh, yea, they did. Of course ... but that's like I say, we
came and we went and we came again, you know back and
forth.
MT: Now that would be about 1934.
AT: Yea, trying to change it.
MT: What do you remember about the strikes Anna?
AT: Oh, that was something. That was a parade I'm telling
you.
MT: Which strike do you remember?
AT: Oh, it was the strike of 1922 I think.
MT: Is that the one you remember the most?
AT: Yea, we lived down to prairie, down to tents. We had
tents put up. We were under the United Mine Workers
strike.
MT: Now, you were still living in East Carbon, in Sunnyside
in '22.
AT: Yea, but when the strike came we moved down in the tents.
46

 ANNA TOLICH
All the strikers moved down. We were down in prairie.
MT: Oh, you were out of your houses?
AT: Yea, yea.
MT: Did the company force you out of your houses?
AT: Well, the strikers wanted us to be together, you know, so
we just closed our home. We didn't sell it or anything, you know. And when the strike was settled we went back to our home. That was about how it was. But I know...
MT: What were they striking for in '22?
AT: Well, for better wages, you know and pensions and like
that.
MT: Health care?
AT: Health care. And uh ...
MT: Lets see, was that the year that they had difficulty with
the National Miners Union so the men were divided, and
finally the United Mine Workers came here?
AT: I think how it was that the National and the United Mine Workers... there were two of them. And John L. Lewis I think pushed on to have the National. And by pushing that, the company turned to the United Mine Workers. He
was a smart... he was a smart potato.
MT: And then they discredited the National Miners Union. Is
that what it was called?
AT : Yea , the National Miners Union.
MT: You know, calling them all Communists, they were able to
47

 ANNA TOLICH discredit them.
AT: Yea, they just named the name, you know. Yea he was smart. He was.
MT: Oh, he was.
AT: That way he told them, you know, well if you don't want
this group you better take us, and so they did. They
settled with the United Mine Workers.
MT: And what was that leader, the United Mine Workers .. . I am
trying to think of his name . . AT: Here in....
MT: In Carbon County. Bonacci?
AT: Bonacci. Yea, he was quite a sharp fellow .
MT: You would remember him wouldn't you?
AT: Yea, I remember him.
MT: He was just finishing up his time in the state
legislature when I was going to college up there. I
remember.
AT: Yea, he was a very intelligent man. And he was for the
workers, you know. And, so, I guess they probably got together with John L. Lewis, you know, and figured out what shall we do. Lets have the two of them, you know, and keep pushing for one and they will go and switch to the other and that's what we want.
MT: Do you remember any violence during that strike?
AT: Oh, of course. It was violent. It was fighting going on,
48

 ANNA TOLICH you know.
MT: Did you have much of it up there?
AT: And they had. . . they put some of them in jail for a
while, you know. It wasn't anything real... I mean it was some ... tempers flew, you know ... I don't think ... I don't think it was anyone really killed, you know.
MT: Do you remember Mother Jones coming here?
AT: Y ea, I remember. I remember.
MT: I think that was the year she came to Helper and they had
to hide her to get her out of town or something. I remember Dr. Dalpaiz telling that story. His dad hid her. What do you remember about that?
AT: Not, you know, really, I don't know too much. But I heard that name quite often, you know. And they says "Boy, she was really ... she was the one that got the guts ... "
MT: So your husband joined the United Mine Workers?
AT: Yea, he was a member from the time he joined to the last
breath of his life.
MT: Do you remember the 1933 Strike?
AT: Y ea, I remember some.
MT: Do you remember very much about that one? Where were you
living in 1933?
AT: Well, I was here in Carbon County.
MT: Were you in Spring Glen? Had you bought your house in
Spring Glen.
49

 ANNA TOLICH
AT:
Well, we built the house. He just bought the land. Well, we lived in Spring Glen. I think we lived with my brother-in-law and sister Francis, together. We didn't have a family of course. See, Eleanor was born in 1934 and then the others... I don't remember too much, you know. It seems like it was settled, you know without serious injury of anybody, you know. It was more the tempers and patience.
Do you remember how you related to the other women in the strike? For example, did you remember my mother-in-law? I knew her well. In fact I think we marched in that parade together and Dorothy Matich, and a group of us. Yea, I remember her very well, a very nice lady, yea. Very active.
I think she organized an auxiliary of women.
MT:
AT:
MT:
AT: Yea. We got along fine.
MT: AT:
MT: AT:
And they all really supported their husbands?
Yes, they did. They did. Of course, like I say myself, even to this day at my age, I get along with everybody. I know you do Anna, you do.
I mean, maybe everybody don't like me, you know. I wish they did. But I am not going to shed tears. You know what, if they don't like me in this world, who knows, maybe in heaven. Like I tell the ladies, when the Lord calls me, I am going to start a kitchen band up there.
50

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Do you have any stories that you would like to share with
us about the early days in Carbon County? Anything in particular that you remember? Some that you belong to... What other kinds of fun and entertaining things did you and your husband do together?
AT: Well, there was a baptism. You know Bob Starr and Matt Starr, you know his dad when they christened the baby, everybody was invited, you know. And it was the same thing in Sunnyside, you know. If there was a baptism or wedding, everybody was invited. It was kind of like a family, you know.
MT: And what would you do at the baptism and the weddings? AT: Well, I loved to dance. I always loved dancing. And I
loved the music. And occasionally, I'd even sing.
MT: And where did they get the band? Did they have bands, or
who provided the music?
AT: Well, yea. They had Frank Milano, used to play the piano
accordion. And one of the other fellows, you know, played with him some time, you know. They played... And then there was some of the old timers, Slovenian fellows, they had a button box accordion, you know, and they played, you know. And it was kind of a mix up, you know. What I mean a mix of this and that. Some of them played the piano, and I don't know. They just got together, you know.
51

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Oh, your memory is good of those years.
AT: Oh, yea. It is good. I wouldn't change them for anything. MT: I can imagine. It must have been...
AT: And school days. If the teacher said we're going up the
canyon and bring your lunch, we thought that was something special. We played ball up there, you know, and just, you know, had fun.
MT: So you did do that in school?
AT: Yea, oh yea. Yea. And we had a lot of respect for the
American Flag in my days. We went out and we said a pledge of allegiance and you know. And had a lot of good things.
MT: Now I want to ask you. Coming here as a child of 5, how did you become a citizen. Did you have to take out papers later on or?
AT: Yea, in order to qualify for American citizenship I did take some classes and I studied some of the by-laws.
MT: So when did you become a citizen Anna?
AT: Well, what was I, sixty? 62 or 63, something like that ...
age.
MT: Oh, before you got your citizenship papers?
AT: No. Ask me the question again.
MT: No, when did you become a citizen of the United States? AT: Yea, it was in 19 ... 19 ... lets see ...
MT: Did your husband become a citizen?
52

 ANNA TOLICH
AT:
MT:
AT: MT: AT: MT:
AT:
Yes, we both did. They had some classes here in Spring... in Helper.
Was it before you were married or after your were
married?
After I was married.
Then you became a citizen.
Yea, after I was married.
So in those days when they came over here, they didn't have to get their citizenship right away. They could work?
They could work without getting, you know... But if you wanted to vote, and have something to say, you know, you almost needed to be a citizen, you know, of the United States, you know. If you weren't somebody that was an American citizen, you know, and they had their citizenship, they would say well are you a citizen, you know. And some of them would tell you right out, you know, if you are not American citizen, you know, you haven't got that much right, you know. You can't vote. There is a lot of things you'd like to say, you can't do it, you know. They weren't rude about it, you know, but they ...
So it was after. . . Was it very long after you were married that you became citizens, or were able to vote. Oh, yes. Quite after, oh yes. I think, ah ...
MT:
AT :
53

 ANNA TOLICH
MT: Do you remember how old you were when you became a
citizen?
AT: Well, like I say a little while ago, I was over sixty
when I worked for CAP. You know. No, I got my high school diploma when I worked for CAP there. But my citizenship it was in about maybe in the 70's, or something like that. The year of '70 or something like that.
MT: So how did you feel about the system of government here? Of course, you didn't really know too much about the government ...
At: No, no. And I wasn't involved in this and that until later, you know. Well, I always thought it was a good policy, you know. Respect, you know.
MT: And to have that much to say...
AT: Yea, yea, and if I had something to say, you know, I
would disapprove of something, that was fine. We all
don't agree with everything.
MT: Right, we are pretty free to... So after your husband
died, you raised these children, and... how long did you
work for CAPS?
AT: I think I worked for over three years. I think but I'm
not sure or something like that. And I worked before that in a nursing home for just a short while. And Stanna was only two and I felt like I should be home, you know, and bring up my family and then of course this chance came to
54

 ANNA TOLICH
work for Mr. Shultz, you know.
MT: So when you retired, Anna, were you able to get any kind of United Mine Workers retirement?
AT: I had only... I had only medical for one year when my husband passed away for my children and myself.
MT: Really?
AT: One year, and after one year, out. No pension.
MT: You got nothing.
AT: That's right.
MT: So today, what do you...
AT: And I went to quite a few meetings. I donated some money
for this and that and the sculpture they had of John L. Lewis that they had, I donated money for that too, you know. But ...
MT: But basically, then, you didn't get anything from the United Mine Workers in the way of retirement or black lung.
AT: Then, later I did. But I done a lot of running around. MT: So you were able to get black lung?
AT: Yea, I've got black lung now. I am getting black lung
now. And social security. But, I uh, I even went ... where did I go? I went to Provo, and I even went to the meetings, and oh, I did a lot of running. And, uh... Frank Latuda, the young boy, the young fellow, Frank Latuda, I went to him and he remembers my husband, you
55

 ANNA TOLICH
know, that he worked, you know, and this and that. And he helped me quite a bit, you know. I had to have some information about this, you know. One thing I am going to tell you. It was a good thing that I had my health. All the running around that I had to do. I, I, I think I am very blessed that I am in one piece, that I didn't shatter to China, or whatever .
MT: Oh, Anna, I think it is just your spirit. You are just... But you have, you have really had good health all these years .
AT: Yea, that's what, that's what brought me to my health. MT: I don't remember you being ill one time until this recent
surgery.
AT: Yea, I had two surgeries at one time, you know, when I
went to Provo that one time. It was obstruction of the bowels and a hernia. I had two surgeries in Provo at one time. Then of course, for my eyes, to get my renewed driver's license, I had cataracts. I had to have that removed. So I had one eye first then the other. So I am pretty well fixed for a few years.
MT: Well, I want you to tell us all of the things you participate in. You are 85 years old, and every place I go I see Anna Tolich. You sing in our choir at St. Anthony's Church. And you've been singing with us for how long, Anna?
56

 ANNA TOLICH
AT: MT: AT: MT: AT:
MT: AT:
MT: AT:
MT:
AT:
And I've been with the Messiah for a couple of years. For a long time with the Messiah.
Jay Andrus, you know, he was wonderful.
Exactly.
And I enjoyed it. I was the oldest of the group, you know. But I enjoyed it.
Did you sing with them last year too?
No, see, the high school, Russell Wilson, he done that, you know.
Oh, so they didn't have community singers last year. Well, not that I know of. They might have, you know. Not that I know of. He didn't say anything, didn't ask us. Well, you've sung with the choir as long as I have been in it, were you singing before? And that is over 20 years?
Well, I can't quite remember, but I know it has been a long time, you know. And when I wasn't in Alter Society, for a while I wasn't in that, you know, thinking gee I don't know if they would have me. And then kitchen band, it was the same thing. And Mr . and Mrs. Dukes said Anna, why don't you try. You can do it.
How long have you been in that kitchen band? They organized that in the '60s .
Many years, many years, yea, many years.
That's wonderful.
57
MT:
AT: MT:

 ANNA TOLICH
AT: And I really appreciate it, you know, I really do. Since
I love music, you know, and I like people, and uh, so. MT: What other things do you do?
AT: Well, occasionally I bake a couple of loaves of bread,
and if there is someone who isn't feeling good, you know, I stop and give them a loaf of bread. And then, after church, I, uh... we were talking about strudels and, Father Andrew said, "Gee you talking about strudel," you know. And I said, you like strudel? And he says, yes. So I says to Mary Metelko, you know, Mary, I am going to bake a strudel. And so Father Andrew bought that umbrella and the table, you know out there. And so I baked a strudel, and so took a strudel up there. And we had fun
and enjoyed it, you know. Everybody did.
MT: Well, the strudel is a really Eastern European.
AT: Yea, it is.
MT: Everyone over there from Germany to
AT: Yea, Strudel is kind of a, kind of a family, you know,
recipe you might say.
MT: Now, when you make the strudel, do you make the dough
real thin, or ... is your dough really ...
AT: It has to be thin, but not too thin so it is not too
sticky. And you have to roll it as much as you can, as thin as you can. And then you put the warm butter on, and you work it with the palm of your hand to make it as
58

 ANNA TOLICH
thin, stretch it as thin as possible. That's what makes the delicious strudel.
Yea, I've made strudel. I learned to make it. Mrs. Breznick taught me.
Yea, she must have been wonderful. All them European women, you know, they were terrific.
It is interesting. Well, my mother-in-law is Italian. She
MT:
AT:
MT:
AT: MT:
AT:
married my grandfather... Or my father-in-law came from Ljubljana too. Did you know them?
Yea, I know them.
You didn't know them of course before you came. Your parents didn't know them.
No, no. See, some of them settled earlier here you know, than I did. What I mean, I was here in USA but not out, you know... But, oh, I don't know, you know. My mother's strudel and potica, can crepe suzettes, (palacinke') doughnuts, and all that. That was a must, you know. Home baked bread, you know, noodles, you know, that was a
must.
MT: Do you, do you still make all these dishes for your
family?
AT: I don't, I don't make the noodles. My sister, Teta Bond
would do that, and I would bake something and bring something done. But Mary Klarich, you ought to see, she made a bunch, a big group of home noodles, and she
59

 ANNA TOLICH
brought me, gave me them noodles.
MT:
AT:
MT: AT: MT: AT:
So how are they making their noodles now? Do they buy those machines that they ... ?
Some of them do, but Mary Klarich does them by hand just like my sister, Teta Bond.
Cuts them with that noodle cutter.
With a knife.
Oh with a knife.
You roll them. You roll them and you, uh, roll them like a jelly roll, you know. Kind of fold them. And then have a sharp knife. And then you hold your fingers a certain way. I think I would probably cut my thumb off, or my finger if I done. But my sister, she had crippled hands, you know, the arthritis, but could she go. She could just go like this, and them noodles ... And Mary Klarich too, she is terrific. And quite a few women, you know. But I, like I say, my sister made the noodles and Mary Klarich made them, so they furnished me, so... but like I say, I tackled the patista and the strudels and the doughnuts, but I didn't tackle the noodles, you know. I let the ladies do that for me. I really appreciated it, you know.
MT: Did you make a lot of stews?
AT: Yea, in my days we done a lot of stews and soups, you
know. And of course, sometimes we would make dumplings, you know. With not always noodles, you know, vegetables,
60

 ANNA TOLICH
you know. And then roasts, a nice roast. Now, when our men went hunting. . . My husband loved to hunt, deer hunting. That was his hobby. And, we would, we would bottle deer meat. We would make kielbasa with deer meat.
MT: Just a minute ...
AT: You don't want to spend the night here do you? Send me
home.
MT: It's all right. Well, we will wind up here, it has been
almost two hours. All right now tell us about making
kielbasa.
AT: Oh, the men went deer hunting. So we would take the deer
meat and then get some pork so it wasn't so dry, and we would make kielbasa sausage. And we would bottle the sausage. And we would cut the meat in pieces and make stew, . and we bottled that too, my sister and I, Teta Bond.
MT: So did you have a smokehouse?
AT: Yea, my sister, Teta Bond in Spring Glen had a
smokehouse. They probably knocked it down, whoever, you
know, got the place. I don't know. MT: But you would smoke the meat ... AT: Meat, and...
TAPE ENDS .
