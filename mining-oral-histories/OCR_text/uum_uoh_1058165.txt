CE: Thank you very much, Mr. Harvey, for allowing me to come to your post office this morning and talk with you about your contribution to Union Carbide and the Uranium Industry on the Colorado Plateau. Before we begin discussing your particular area, will you tell me where you were born, and where you were raised and educated?
HH: Sure. I was born in Salt Lake City and I was educated at the University of Utah. I graduated from the University of Utah in 1949. After that I travelled through mining areas in Montana, Utah, and California where I went to work for Union Carbide and Textile there. This was about 1956. I went to Reno, Nevada in exploration, and in 1957 I came to the Plateau to work in the Uranium mines. I came here as a mining engineer and worked for Jim Borden in Uravan. I soon became the mine foreman and worked in the Nell mine and the Ukapello mine and the Paradox D, the Paradox 5 and 6 mine. I then went to work at the Ulla Bella
as a mine superintendent and worked there until about 1964. No, '65. After I worked there for a while I was transferred back into the Uravan office as Jim Borden's assistant. Just last year I was transferred

 H.J. HARVEY #1
into the Grand Junction Office as Chief Mine Engineer. That about sums up my history on the Plateau.
Did you get your degree in--?
In Mining Engineering.
At the University of Utah?
Right.
Will you tell me about the mines at Uravan? Which are the biggest producers, for instance, and which of them [were] worked the longest?
Well, the Hubbard mine is probably the best known. It had extremely thick and high grade ore and it was worked prior to my arrival by many years. It is probably the single most important producer in the Uravan area. The Daravel mine out of Dove Creek is another very large producer and is one of our better producers today. I don't know the reserves that have come out of there, but I imagine that it would--let
me do a little figuring. It would be well up around 500,000 tons that come from that mining complex. Paradox D was another good producer in the Uravan area, it produced a couple hundred thousand tons. I think one of the oldest mining areas in Uravan is around the Club area. I understand that the uranium used in Madame Curie's experiment was extracted from
CE: HH: CE: HH: CE:

 H.J. HARVEY #1
the Coronary mines. But I couldn't verify that.
CE: I've heard that several times too.
HH: Long Park area is another highly productive area, it
produced quite a bit of ---?--- along with the uranium. Principally the district in the early days was the ---?--- mining district. I understand the uranium was allowed to go down the river, and by rather sketchy hand-to-mouth knowledge has it that Mr. Burwell, a mill superintendent of Uravan, was the first one to start noticing or realizing the future importance of uranium and started to extract it on an experimental basis. Again, I can't verify that. I've never heard that of any--
CE: I've heard that.
HH: And the Dolores area. I don't name mines because I
think the districts themselves, the benches and the bases that have these mines are more important than naming individual mines. But I would say that the Club area is probably the oldest district or the oldest mining area in the district. I can show you on the--my knowledge of the mining methods could be stated in the following manner. In the early days the mining was carried on from the rims where the deposits were obvious or discovered as outcrops; the deposits were mined right from the rim. There was
3

 H.J. HARVEY #1
very little extensive developing going to depth. As these rims deposits have been mined out by hand mucking and later slushers and ---?--- muckers,
loading in the cars and what have you, they wheel these to the rim and dump them in the ore bin, dump the ore in the ore bins. This is all I think of the past pretty much, and even though we still mine from the rim on some occasions the distances from the rims to the ore bodies has increased a great amount and the ore bodies are found in from the rim so far that very often we have to sink vertical shafts or incline shafts now to hoist the rock out rather than travel on horizontal rims. The mining has by necessity become more mechanized because of this, along with the increased labor costs. We've had to increase efficiency by mechanization. We've progressed from
slushers and track-type mining
locomotives and little small mine cars to haul, to haul the rock to the shaft stations and then hoist it. We get all--our developing into trackless miming
where we use underground you might say trucks and tractor trailers. We load the ore with front-end loaders. Then it's transported underground in these trucks to the shaft stations where it again is hoisted. We've found it more feasible not to hoist it
4
where we use

 H.J. HARVEY #1
right on out to the surface on long gently slopping inclines. So you have a picture of loading an underground truck with a front-end loader. It can haul up to a couple of miles out to the surface without it ever being transferred to the shaft or what have you and hoisted, dumped into the ore bin.
CE: That's more economical, isn't it?
HH: We think it is. Yes.
CE: Well, the equipment wasn't really available until
lately, or maybe we just didn't recognize the importance of it. As the economics got poorer and poorer we realized that we either had to change or we were going to go out of business, so again as these deposits became deeper in depth they were harder to find and we had to spend more money finding them, and after we found them it cost more money to get to them to mine. Generally I believe that we found that the further in from the rims that these deposits are the more costly it has been to mine them because of increased services and costs of underground transportation. So the whole picture has been one of increased cost and increased mechanization trying to
maintain the cost per ton of ore extracted. V entalization has progressed from a point of practically no ventilation--when you listen to the
5

 H.J. HARVEY #1
old-timers talk they talk where the ventalization was provided through a four inch vent hole, and virtually through a four inch vent hole at any depth you get practically no movement of air. We are now putting air down forty-two inch holes and we're talking about going to sixty inch holes. Sixty inch diameter. We were moving as many as 150,000 feet per minute through some of the mines that we're operating, so ventalization has greatly improved. I believe this has helped provide a better atmosphere for the miners to work in and they're able to be more productive by this.
CE: Define the nature of the ventilation and what's required. How you define where it's necessary, for instance, and develop the cost of it.
HH: I don't understand your question.
CE: Well, Mr. Beverly, explained why this is necessary.
Of course I understand that, but what I haven't been able to ascertain is how you define how large the vent hole should be, for instance, and also how this equipment is--where it is placed and what type of equipment is involved and how much it costs, for instance, for one vent hole.
HH: Well, first of all we, we determine the relationship of the discovered ore body in respect to other mine
6

 H.J. HARVEY #1
openings or the surface, and after the preliminary analysis of the nature we can then determine how we might want to mine this. Then from this we determine the amount of docile equipment we want underground and using the horsepower and the number of men that we had underground and try to determine ahead of time what the radiation problems are going to be. We can determine very roughly how much air we want to put underground through the hole. Then our ventilation
engineer, Mr. Swindle, is able by that economic analysis to determine what size ventilation hole that we need to put this air down. Of course you have to balance this against the horsepower that's required to push that amount of air down different sized holes. The bigger the hole of course the more the initial cost of its excavation is. As the mine progresses away from the initial vent hole further analyses are needed to determine if additional air is needed and how much additional air, and the same analysis is repeated. We leapfrog from some of our deeper mines; we leapfrog from one ore deposit to the next. We can generally go out a couple thousand feet from one vent hole to the next; we can go two thousand feet before we need another ventilation hole. This may hang--if the government standards are
7

 H.J. HARVEY #1
increased we may have to have more vent holes.
CE: So you predicate what's necessary on government regulations?
HH: Well, not necessarily. We have our own regulations that we have to follow which are pretty much in line with the government regulations. But much of our requirements as to ventilation were prior to government regulations. I think this--I think maybe what you're trying to get to is the radiation problem that we have. Well, in the late fifties there were many people who started to talk about the relationship between radiation and cancer. Well, many of us (and I for one) didn't think there was very much ground for this analysis, but as time went on and more and more of the old-timers were dying of lung cancer we decided that there was more to it than
meets the eye. Some of the people in the late fifties in our organization, and I think Vern Bishop was one of them, could see that whether there was any truth in it or not we were going to have to improve it until it cleared the picture up. Jim Borden at the time was another one who felt that even if there wasn't any truth in the radiation, increased ventilation would help the miners produce more, it would be an economic gain that way. Because a miner
8

 H.J. HARVEY #1
working in a poor atmosphere could be as low as
50% efficient because of headaches, nausea, and this
sort of thing.
CE: Well, what caused that? I talked with a miner last
week who mentioned the headaches and probably the first time--
RH: Powder. Explosives. The fumes from the explosives that are left in the mines give a person a headache, extreme headache and nausea. A miner will develop a certain degree of resistance to this as he worked longer and longer in a mine, but under extremely bad situations I don't think they ever get completely over to where they are immune to it. See, a lot of the powder gases are left in the broken rock, and when a miner starts to move that, to load it in the trucks or cars or wheelbarrows or what have you, that stirs these gases up and gets in the mine atmosphere. Well, Jim being very foresighted could see where if
we had adequate ventilation the miner would feel much better and be able to work more effectively. So anyway, from that starting point the company, to my knowledge, has led state and federal agencies in the control that we had. We're down to a point now where I think we are getting a very difficult situation trying to reach a four working level. Here our three-
9

 H.J. HARVEY #1
tenths working level is extremely difficult and extremely expensive and even--it may not put some uranium mines out of business, but it certainly is going to tax the year round mineral belt to stay in business under these controls. There's sufficient evidence right now I believe, at least in my opinion, that reaching the three-tenths working level is not necessary. Reaching the one working level is probably not necessary and I, for one, would feel very safe in working in anything at five working levels. It seems
like a pretty high figure, but we've come from the fifties that were a ten working level; a ten working level was shut down; we all felt like we were working pretty safe levels under ten. Now we're talking about three-tenths. It seems like it's pretty unattainable.
CE: How frequently do you check to see that these requirements are met?
HH: Every working place is sampled once a week.
CE: Oh, is it? Once a week. You have an individual who
does just that? HH: Yes.
CE: This ventilation engineer to whom you referred?
HH: No. We have---?--- samplers stationed in Uravan and
Dove Creek.
They travel all the mines, the company and the contract, and sample all the working places.
10

 H.J. HARVEY #1
So we have a pretty good record of what people are exposed to.
CE: How do you keep record of the individuals who work in the mine as far as their exposure is concerned?
HH: Well, we have radiation cards that our employees and every other man is required to fill out, and there's a space for the person to write down the description of the working place by number of any other notation. There's a mine number which every mine has and every working place has a number which he marks down, and then there's a space for every day of the week. An employee is supposed to mark down the hours that he's in each one of these working areas. By knowing from the sampling, we know what each working place is running in working levels. We can then determine at the end of the year how much the man has been subjected to during the year. The record of this is put out every month, so we know when a man is becoming what we would term "overexposed" and we would be able to transfer him to another working area where the radiation levels are lower.
CE: I can see that this would be practical for a company as large as Union Carbide, but how practical would that be for an independent contractor who had minus room supply? He can't rotate these people in the same
11

 H.J. HARVEY #1 manner, can he?
HH: It's extremely difficult for some small miners, because like you say there are mines that are approaching a working level limit, near the area, so
if he does happen to get one man overexposed his only course is to terminate the man or put him on the surface. Very few small independents can afford to put a man on the surface. So the alternative is to turn the man loose, and to my knowledge there is nothing to keep this man from going to work in another mine where he could be overexposed again.
CE: Can't the Public Health Service somehow control this? I know that they initiated the work in this area. They were the first to think or recognize that this
was a problem, and apparently because of their efficiency AEC decided that they should be responsible. But does the Public Health Service then keep track of these miners and the number of hours that they're worked underground?
HH: No. I believe is all that they do is they have the right to inspect the radiation records kept by each company or private individual.
CE: Dr. Ellenwood, when I interviewed him he mentioned that the Public Health Service was keeping track of some 5,000 miners who had gone through this area
12

 H.J. HARVEY #1
since the boom years. That's why I brought that up.
HH: They're keeping track of it strictly from a research project where they can virtually determine--with a great deal of accuracy, I suppose--to what the threshold lim its might be.
CE:
But it seems as though it wouldn't be too accurate if the independent miner isn't as conscientious as is Union Carbide about this. This is the first time I've seen a card. I hope that you'll let me have one of those for this tape, to insert in the file. Would you allow me to do that?
HH: I believe that we can. I'll check with Bob Beverly. He's the guy that would be able to give us the--legal secret all over the company and contract mines.
CE: Would you develop for me now the procedure you use for open-pit mining? For instance, at Gas Hill I know that it's different. I've seen pictures of the open- pit mines, and it's very difficult for me to
visualize how the mining progresses. Can you give me a step by step procedure for that and then discus also this ventilation problem or whether it exists at all?
HH: Well, in an open-pit it doesn't exist. There's natural ventilation flow of air that would keep the radiation levels down to an acceptable limit. It
13

 H.J. HARVEY #1
values it's--again now, my open-pit experience in Wyoming is only one of an observer. I've gone up there occasionally and worked in the pit. But I can tell you what my impressions/sketchy knowledge is. I think the ore bodies are two to three hundred feet deep and they're typical. When I say typical they're comparable to ---?--- ore bodies in that they are thin and generally they're lower grade. The overlying
rock is soft and it's stripped; they strip the overberth with what we call cams and pusher cats, dozers. Caterpillars that twist these cams along and the cams have a bottom on 'em that opens up in front and accepts the rock. As the cam is pushed forward by stripping a small depth each pass they are able to load the cam. The cam then closes up and there's a small cab on the front with a motor and it holds this cam along to a discharge point and pulls it out of the pit. And by progressing in this fashion they are able to make a circular pit down over the ore body to a point where they uncover the ore body. Then it's loaded with train leaders. When I was up there I had
a small shovel, deisel type shovels. We'd load them into trucks and haul on into the mill. That's about all I know about it.
CE: Why did they do it in that fashion? Why open-pit 14

 H.J. HARVEY #1 mining?
HH: As compared to underground? Well, the engineers who studied the feasibility of this determined that they could strip this softer rock cheaper than we could sink a shaft and drift out to the ores---?---. It's extremely cheap mining once you get down to the ore.
CE: Can you make an analogy? If you talk about the fact that it's less expensive?
HH: Well, mining in the Uravan area underground is in the neighborhood of $18 a ton; mining in a pit probably wouldn't exceed $1 a ton. So it's just a matter of weighing how much you can strip and mine against how much you can blow up and mine underground.
CE: And it is less, the quality of ore is not as high as it is in the Uravan ore belt?
HH: Well, only because the deposits are not as high a grade. They're pretty low grade to begin with.
CE: But they're large, aren't they?
HH: They're larger and they're more consistent.
CE: How does one close a big hole such as that? Or is it
necessary to do that?
HH: Well, to this point in our history it's not really
necessary.
CE: I had read just recently that the government was
going to require that these be closed. Is that 15

 H.J. HARVEY #1 correct?
HH: That's right. Well, they are talking about this. I don't think there's any legislation as yet. But there is talk that the people are going to have to close these holes up, and I do think that in some coal mines they have to close the pits up and rejuvenate the surface. In this case the miner doing the stripping has to take the topsoil and pile it to one soil and take the rock and pile it to another, and then put them back in their proper order and reseed the surface. But the mines haven't got to this point yet. The---?--- mine.
CE: Do you think the reason for this is our emphasis on ecology?
HH: The reason for doing--?
CE: For having to close these.
HH: I think so, yes.
CE: How do you feel about it? Do you think that this
should have to be done?
HH: Well, I think you have to look at it from two
different ways. It's like a lot of problems of this nature: it would be nice if you could put all the rock back in the mines and all the rock back in the pits and reseed the surface and leave it as you found it. This all sounds real ideal. But this all costs
16

 H.J. HARVEY #1
money, and are you willing to pay twice as much for power that you might get from atomic energy or are you willing to pay for this extra "pollution control?" A company that's got to control pollution
is going to spend millions of dollars to control it. Well, this millions of dollars spent has to be paid
for by the increased price for the commodity.
CE: They were talking about that in Southern California because of the terrible smog problems that we have
and this particular question has been posed to I 'm sure everyone, virtually everyone, but it's obvious that we have to do something about our pollution problem, because I've been following this very closely. I'm raising a child in that atmosphere and I'm---?---. The colonies for this, the Air Pollution Control District has been working closely with the county to determine whether the smog control devices or F-3IO, the Standard Oil Company additive are effective. Virtually every report that has been made indicated that these, the devices and the gasoline additives are ineffectual.
HH: The F-3IO is ineffectual, you say?
CE: I have read two reports. The state did a study, a
three month study, as did the Orange County commune in which we live. The county said that some of the
17

 H.J. HARVEY #1
emissions had decreased but others had increased, and the state said that the F-3IO was ineffectual.
HH: Well, I just saw the commercial the other night on F- 3IO and I wondered then if it was as good as they said it was. If it was as good as they said it was it would really be a revolution to the internal combustion engine. I don't know, it's--I agree with you as the population increases and the activities of the human [race] increases it does seem imperative that something be done. The companies, I think Union Carbide for one--I'm just blowing my horn--but I think they're doing as much as a lot of companies and more than many. For instance, up at Rifle we ultimately have up here--they just took, we only had a variance, you've probably heard about this?
CE: No, I haven't.·No.
HH: You haven't?
CE: I've heard about it, but tell me again because it's
interesting to hear other people's point of view of
these things.
HH: They had a variance to deviate from the standards
that would last through sometime this fall, and they had been working on the project for sometime now and they've got it to the point where they just asked for the variance to be taken off at an early date. In
18

 H.J. HARVEY #1
other words, they've reached the standards before they needed, before their variances ran out, but we were fortunate in Rifle that we were able to make these corrections economically and not raise havoc with the economies. But some plants just are not that
fortunate to be in that situation, and many of these plants have to go by the wayside. But your power plants in New York and those areas have got to go by the wayside too, so what are you going to replace them with? Hydro-electric I understand kills a fish, raises havoc there.
CE: Prior to my coming to the Plateau I talked with my brother-in-law who is a chemist of many years experience and to a friend of ours who is a physicist. Both of these people have, during their careers, worked on atomic energy related projects. Cerguy Goleon, the physicist, was very emphatic in his telling of how radiation does not do the damage that many laymen think that it does. Most people who are not informed in these areas are afraid of something that they don't understand. He was, of course, enduring the use of atomic energy for
peaceful purposes. He explained that ---?--- fumes really give more harm than does the radiation from atomic energy.
19

 H.J. HARVEY #1
HH: I wouldn't be surprised a bit. We have had certain--
well, a doctor--well, it doesn't matter. A radiologist down here--I'11 think of it in a few minutes.
CE: You're not thinking of Dr. Sakamoto?
HH: Sakamoto, yes.
CE: He's a pathologist.
HH: Pathologist. Anyway he had some charts out that
indicated that a nonsmoking uranium miner had a better chance of avoiding cancer than a nonsmoker in the population. Which indicated to me at least that he was breathing a better atmosphere than the general population. A smoking uranium miner had a high instance rate of 1ung cancer, which provoked the company into endorsing a non-smoking safety rule underground which is pretty well adhered to, in fact. I haven't heard of any violations lately at all. But anyway it would seem to me that the smog in these cities is just an injurious to the lungs as radiation. Certainly cigarette smoking is an add-on factor in both cases.
CE: Is there anything else that you would like to contribute?
HH: Why I can't think of anything.
CE: I certainly would thank you for your time. I
20

 H.J. HARVEY #1
appreciate it very much.
HH: O.K. Thank you.
