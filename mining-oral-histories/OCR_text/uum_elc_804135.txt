TODAY IS OCTOBER THE THIRD, 1988. WE'RE RECORDING WITH WILLIAM M. PURDY, FORMER HEAD MASTER, ROWLAND HALL AND ST. MARK'S SCHOOL. WE'RE RECORDING IN THE MARRIOTT LIBRARY. THIS IS PART OF THE COOLEY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. [TAPE #1]
EC: Bill, let's begin by having you tell us something about your beginnings; where, when you were born, something of your family background.
WP: I spent the first thirteen years of my life in Superior, Wyoming, which is about twenty miles north of Rock Springs, in a coal mining town. My grandfather was a coal miner in England and a convert to the Mormon church. At that time the coal fields in Wyoming and Utah were just opening up. There was a great need for skilled miners so the coal company executives set up their own little immigration companies, you might say. They would loan bread winners of families enough money to get to Wyoming.
EC: Something like the Mormon Perpetual Immigration Fund? WP: Yes, it's actually very much so. And my grandfather
c am e fir s t , a1 one . He p a i d b a c k h i s 1 o a n , a t h i g h interest rate I might say, and then saved enough money to bring the family. EC: Was Superior one of the typical mining company towns? WP: It was a typical mining town, but unlike other mining towns it had more than just one or two companies mining coal. EC: So it wasn't one owned by Union Pacific, who owned so

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 many of the coal mines up there?
WP: The Union Pacific was a major company there, but when I came along, there were seven companies mining coal i n Su p e r i o r . A1 though it was c l a s s i f i e d as a town , there were different camps associated with each company. Our particular camp was called SuperiorRock Springs. It was owned by an Ogden, Utah concern, and my father was mine foreman. It was about half way up the valley that was about three miles long. It was a very interesting place in the desert.
EC: Was the population rather cosmopolitan because of the regions the miners had been drawn from?
WP: Oh yes, extremely cosmopolitan. As a matter of fact I read in a research paper on Superior that there were fifty-four nationalities represented. I was very aware of that growing up because we had friends who were Greek, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, the Balkan countries were well represented-all nationalities. I just took it for granted that that's the way the world was. It was a very good thing for me. I didn't realize how good it was until much later. I noticed that in my dealings with my cousins from Mormon towns in Utah, they were not sophisticated and didn't really understand the cosmopolitan nature of the world. They were very
2

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1
narrow, not by design, but simply because they didn't have the experience of dealing with other people. I thought that was interesting. EC: In connection with this heterogeneous group, how did this carry over into the school system? For instance, my first teaching in high school was at Bingham High, where you had a polyglot group. There is one thing however, I was a little fearful in going there of all this rough and tumble element, these foreigners. In contrast to what I had been led to believe, there was instilled in those kids a respect for the teacher. The teacher was someone you looked up to. Was this the sort of thing you experienced in Superior? WP: Oh, absolutely. As a matter of fact I thought the schools in Superior, were superior to the schools we came to in Utah. I came to Utah at age thirteen. My sister was a senior in high school. She found, and of course she expresses it better than I do because she had a longer experience, that the Utah schools were inferior to the Wyoming schools. I have a theory about that. Most of the teachers in Wyoming were from the East, many from New England. They came to Wyoming, starting in the 1870s. These girls continued to come all the way up through to the depression. Many girls from the east came west, especially to
3

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 Wyoming.
EC: Why do you suppose that was so? WP: Well, there was the romantic part of it. EC: That's what I was wondering, The Virginian thing. WP: That's right. The Virginian was there and they were
a11 f am i 1 i a r with that book . I think that was the number one reason they came to Wyoming. They did come to other western states, but not the same degree they then carne to Wyoming. Of course everything else was in Wyoming too. Wyoming represented all of the romantic west more so than Utah, Idaho, and Nevada. It was all there in Wyoming. The sophisticated men weren't drawn to Wyoming, but the women were, which I thought was interesting. But they did have good schools. I remember as a child I could speak Greek, because my neighbors were Greek and I learned it along with the kids. I lost it unfortunately. EC: What about the religious community? You said that many came from the Balkan regions. Did you have a good representation of the Greek Orthodox or the Eastern Orthodox? WP: Oh yes, yes. The Orthodox Church was one of the strong religions in the camp, as were many others like Catholics and Buddhists and of course most of your Northern Europeans came as Mormon converts.
4

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 EC: Is that right? WP: Yes. EC: So there was a strong Mormon influence in Superior? WP: Yes, you didn't find too many Protestant people in
the camps. If they were not Catholic or Orthodox they were Mormons. In fact all of the Mormons had roots in Northern Europe, England and the Scandinavian Countries. The missionaries did a good job. I didn't realize until I got older, just why that make up was there. The religion played an important role in my upbringing. I found it hard as did most children in Mormon families to understand what we were being taught in church because it didn't jive with what we were learning in the community. You were in that society and that's all there was to it. The children didn't have nearly the problems that the adults had. The Mormon adults tended to isolate themselves, the children did not, unless the parents we~e very, very strict. There were one or two families like that. For most of them it was just too much trouble to try to rein in their children, so they tried to give them a good upbringing, but they let them associate with the society in general. We found it very cosmopolitan. Our neighbors for instance, I had one neighbor who was a good Catholic and another was Greek Orthodox
5

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 and they were wonderful, wonderful people. As a matter of fact I loved them dearly. I couldn't understand how my Sunday school teacher could say that they were bound for hell. At the time I was growing up, the Catholic Church was a bad word in our church.
EC: Great abomination. WP: Oh, my mother used to think that the Catholic Church
was satanic. My mother was a wonderful person, but she certainly had her prejudices-. EC: You moved to Salt Lake when you were about thirteen? WP: No , we d i d n ' t move to Sa 1 t Lake . During the depression the mines closed in Superior. My father was mine foreman. We were lucky in that he got a job with the same company in the mines of Carbon County, Utah. So we moved to a place called Wattis, which is just west of Price. That was a very traumatic thing for the children, especially climatically. Superior was true desert. We didn't even have a water supply, it was brought in by the railroad. You can imagine thirteen years with two barrels of water a week. And that was for everything, drinking, washing, clothes, and dishes. How we did it I don't know, but we did it. That had a great deal to do with how my character was formed also. Water became central to life. It was
6

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1
almost religious in scope in that we'd watch in the summertime when the clouds formed west of Superior over the Wasatch. The elders would gather and talk about whether we were going to get anything out of these clouds. I found it difficult breathing in anticipation of rain. We very seldom got anything, but when it did rain it was really an event. I remember my mother took every pan she had and would place it under the roof tops where water drained. We would have QUr one bath in rain water and it was also the one bath where we got to use the water just for ourselves. EC: I'm going to ask you, were there in your mother's eyes certain attributes to rain water that you didn't find in any other? For instance, in my own family we did have a well, but the rain water they always claimed was softer. So they'd catch this for the laundry and particularly for their hair. If they had good rain water for their hair this was something special. WP: Oh, absolutely. The way she described this I thought, "You ought to market it," (laughter) because it was so wonderful. Of course because she thought so, I thought so too, bathing in rain water was really something, at least I thought it was something.
7

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 EC: Even though it might be a little brown in color as I
remember, it was caught as it ran off the roof. WP: It was wonderful. Coming to Wattis, which was in the
mountains right on the boundary between the steppe and the alpine climates was altogether different. You actually had springs and streams and wonderful trees. There was no vegetation in Superior, nothing. In the springtime you got a few little blue bells. We used to think they were so pretty, but even the sagebrush were dwarfed. That's all. So it was really desert. EC: Now, what about the community of Wattis. Was the population and make up similar in that coal town or did you find major differences from what you'd experienced in Superior? WP: Yes, there was a difference. Wattis was much smaller. EC: Now it was a company town? WP: It was a company town, that's right. Every house in the town was owned by the company. Everything in the town was owned by the company and it was very small, maybe thirty, thirty-five families. There were more people working there but they all drove in from Price or from Huntington or Ferron. I would say that most of the miners lived elsewhere, so it was a little different. Most of the people who lived in Wattis were Anglos--by design or what I don't know. There
8

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 was a boarding house there, however, it closed the same year that we arrived. It was in 1933 when the boarding house closed. I don't know what the make up of that was. Most of the people who lived there were Anglo-Saxon, if not Mormon, I'd say at least half of them were Mormons.
EC: Did you have your own school in Wattis or did you have to be transported to another town?
WP: There was an elementary school and it was a one room school. I was in the seventh grade when we arrived. The teacher taught four grades in the one room. There were two of us in the seventh grade. When I got to the eighth grade I was the only one in the eighth grade. A fellow by the name of Blaine Thompson was the teacher, and he was from somewhere over here. It wasn't Provo but south of Provo someplace there. A scholar, a real scholar, one of the best teachers I ever had. As a matter of fact he's probably the only teacher I had in my elementary and secondary education that I remember at all.
EC: That's what I was going to ask, in your experiences, is there a teacher that stands out that you think had an influence on your life?
WP: Blaine Thompson, I would say, was the best teacher I had. He taught four grades: fifth, sixth, seventh and 9

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 eighth. He had each grade in one row, each one in a row. He would go to the fifth grade and he would instruct them for about fifteen minutes, say in mathematics , then he wo u 1 d g i v e them a forty- five minute assignment to do in mathematics. Then he would go to the sixth grade and he would explain the lesson and then give them an assignment, then the seventh and then the eighth. I listened to everything he said to the fifth, sixth and seventh. So I had a review of all these things. I was able to do that and still work on my lesson. I would never have made if it hadn't been for him.
EC: I've interviewed some people in a similar situation. The teacher employed someone in your position to help in the instruction of the lower. Did you experience that?
WP: No, he didn't do that with anybody. He did it all himself. I did get some privileges, especially if I did well in something. If he thought that I really had been listening, I'd get to go down and stoke the furnace or something like that. That was a great privilege.
EC: You weren't rewarded by being able to ring the school bell?
WP: Well, I think there was that too.
10

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 EC: It was in my school, if you achieved you got to ring
the bell. WP: It was in mine too. That's right. It was a very good
experience, although having so few class mates I was very worried what would happen when I went to Price to high school. It was a large high school because it was the only high school in the county. Like everybody else in the coal camps, we were bused in. I think in my class there were three or four hundred students. Going from the only student in the class to four hundred worried me a great deal. EC: There must have been something e~se. Now what did you do for library facilities in a little school in Wattis? WP: As I recall we didn't have a library. I don't remember one. EC: When you got to Price did a new world open up to you? WP: Yes, I was very frightened. I was afraid to go in the library. I didn't go because I didn't know what to do. It's too bad that people in that school didn't recognize that a student coming out of a small coal camp would have those kind of problems and help you out, but nobody did. EC: Counseling was unheard of in those days? WP: No counseling, absolutely none. Matter of fact, my
11

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 experience in high school was devastating. Although I had a good time and I even enjoyed it once in a while as far as education goes, it was miserable. I thought I was a poor student.
EC: Coming into Price High School you were once again in somewhat the same environment that you had at Superior. You had all the Greek and Mediterranean peoples and so on from the coal camps and railroad.
WP: Yes. Matter of fact, I rode the bus with a Japanese girl and I think I probably owe more to her for my high school education than to any teacher.
EC: Is that right? WP: Yes, because she was a very good student and she
liked me and she helped me a lot. And there were other students too that I remember. EC: Now, since your schedule was sort of geared to when the bus came and went this restricted your extracurricular activities at the high school, did it not? WP: It just made it impossible. It vJas twenty miles to school and in the wintertime we left home in the dark and got home in the dark. We would arrive when school started and as soon as school was out we went home. So there was no room for extra-curricular stuff at all. I told my dad that I wanted to go out for football and he said, "Well, I don't know how you're
12

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 going to do it." But I said, "I'm going to, I'll hitch hike." Well, there were no cars going to Wattis and after walking twenty miles a couple of times I gave that up.
EC: You've said nothing about siblings, other than a sister who came--
WP: I had a brother and two sisters. One sister was younger than I, just three years younger. My brother was three years older and my other sister five years older. I also had a half sister, my father's daughter, who was fifteen years older than I. I was in the seventh grade when I came to Utah. My sister was a senior and my brother was in the ninth grade. I think that's the way it was. They helped too because they were both excellent students. My brother was exceptionally bright. He had one of these rare photographic memories. He could read a book in an hour that would take me a week. He read by the page. I'd watch him and I'd say, "You're not reading that." And he'd hand it to me and say, "Okay. Quiz me."
EC: Speed reading that we know of today was something like what he was doing.
WP: I don't know how he did that but he did it. When we were in the first grade he was totally bored with school. He was a westerner, he was a cowboy, we'd 13

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 always be out in the street with western story magazines. He'd have one with him all the time. That's what he would do in school, he'd read his magazine while all the rest of the kids were being taught to read.
EC: What sort of social and recreational activities did you have both at Superior and Wattis? What was open to you?
WP: We made our own. Nothing was organized by adults. I'm glad that that's the way it happened because I think there is a lot to learn in creativity when you have to invent your own games and that sort of thing, instead of having adults tell you what to do. So if an adult came along and we were playing a game, why we just quit playing until they left.
EC: Do you remember when you first saw a movie? WP: Yes, I do. EC: What year and what were the circumstances? WP: Superior got a movie while we there in the late '20s
and early '30s. Is that when "talkies" came in? About 1930? EC: No, late '20s. WP: Late '20s or '29 or something like that. Well, my oldest sister was my half sister, and a story in herself. She sometimes played the piano in the silent
14

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 movies. I don't know whether you'd want me to tell that story. Let me just say this about her, she was a very bright girl and caused my father endless problems because he didn't know what to do after his wife died, tragically. When she was nine years old he found my mother, which was his good luck. From then on that girl did pretty well, although she fought it tooth and nail when it first started. But anyhow, she was a brilliant musician. When she was only twentysome years old she was selling Baldwin pianos around the country. There were two girls, they were called the Baldwin twins and they would go all over the United States playing and singing and selling Baldwin pianos. I thought it was really something.
EC: Someone from Superior, Wyoming. WP: Yes, can you believe that? But I remember my dad
bought this Philco radio, it was a huge thing. We couldn't get many stations on it, but occasionally we'd get KOA Denver. Two or three times we heard my sister on the radio. Boy, that really made us something, a cut above the rest of the people in the camp. Now I forgot what your question was. EC: Your social, your recreational life, what it was like? WP: Although we were in the coal camps I think we were
15

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 cowboys to a greater extent than the ranch kids or the farm kids in the West. Coal mining kids were real cowboys. We played the cowboy game endlessly. I remember my brother because he was smart and tough always got to be Butch Cassidy. I was a weakling, so I always got to be a sheep herder or something. But we played baseball and football on the rocks. There was no grass, not even on the high school field. When we'd go to Green River, Wyoming, I always thought that was paradise because of all the trees and the water, it was beautiful.
EC: In some communities, and this would be more so where you have a strictly Mormon community, the social life where everything was built around the church, the socials and dancing and so on.
WP: No, that was not true. None of that. I don't remember any church socials. They'd have great celebrations on various days and we used to participate in those. If one of the Czechoslovakian people had a wedding it was a big deal and we got in on it. They didn't mind. As matter of fact they liked that.
EC: Do you ever remember reading an article that appeared in the Utah Historical Quarterly called "A Bohunk Christmas"?
WP: Vaguely, I do remember that. 16

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 EC: It was about the Serbs in Bingham canyon and how it
was more than just the Serbian community, but they included others to come in and participate in this. It was a real celebration described by Dr. Paul Richards. WP: Well, that did happen. EC: Did you experience that sort of thing in your home? WP: Yes, yes. Greek baptisms, they were even better than weddings. I really enjoyed those and would even sneak a drink now and then and everybody would laugh. The food was great. EC: So, when you get to Carbon High School in Price, did you then specialize your interests? Were they concentrated more in any one direction or what happened then? WP: No, as I say, I didn't have any clear direction where I wanted to go or where I was going. I did have a vague feeling that I had to prepare to do something. I thought, well, I' 11 find it, I don't have to look because it'll come. So I did a fairly good job, as far as grades and I tried to do my work and that sort of thing, but I didn't learn very much there. A lot of it was negative. I remember a math teacher that I had that made me feel I could never do mathematics, so I quit trying. Much later I took SAT's in
17

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 mathematics and scored almost seven hundred. This guy had convinced me that I was really incapable of doing math, and he was wrong. He was very wrong. He was wrong at that time too. I think it was because he was very insecure and didn't know math himself. Well, you run into the teachers like that once in a while.
EC: These were depression years. There were cut backs where I went to school because of this. For instance, I had no opportunity to take a foreign language because of the budget restrictions. Did you find this same sort of thing in Carbon County? Could you take a foreign language?
WP: I suppose, I might have. I don't know. I know if I had remained in Superior I would have taken one because it was required.
EC: Oh, is that right? WP: Yes. My sister had three years of French before she
came to Carbon. It was required in Superior, but it wasn't at Carbon.
[END OF SIDE ONE] EC: This is side two of our first interview with William
M. Purdy on the Cooley Oral History Project. He was talking about his education and particularly after he had moved to Carbon County and attending Carbon County High School at Price.
18 .

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 WP: Yes, These people from Southern Europe, the children
were embarrassed with their national origins and they refused to speak their language. EC: Isn't this characteristic of the second generation reaction? WP: Right. Now that wasn't true in Superior but it was in Carbon. EC: That's right. How do you account for that? WP: I don't know. I think because there were so many people in Superior. They had their own culture and enough people to push it. There wasn't quite the stigma and there weren't so many Mormons. That may have been one of the things too, I don't know. Mormons always acted so superior to everybody else. I know my parents always made me feel that we were way superior to anybody else. I actually thought they were right for a while. EC: We spoke about the Depression. In your experience was this a major event in the lives of your family? You said that the mines closed in Superior because of this. What about the life down in Wattis because of the Depression, how did this change your life? WP: The Depression, as I remember it, was one of the best of times. We didn't feel it at all. My father was never out of work and for children it was just a
19

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 wonderful time. Although we didn't have money we had everything else. Just one example. In Wattis the mine was situated about a mi 1 e and a ha 1 f from the town . When the coal trips were not running, the people who were working had to get up to the mine some way. The company had some horses, about five or six horses. They maintained them, they had a nice barn. At the beginning of the shift there were certain people that had to get themselves up there so the others could get up t h톏 r e . We 11 , they ' d r i d e the hor s e s . I n t h e summer time, during the Depression, the mines didn't work. So the horses were there with nothing to do. So t h e mi n e o wn e r s a i d to the kid s in the town , "Yo u take these horses on the mountain and keep them all summer and you can ride them. Just take care of them and bring them back in the fall." So that's what we did and we had a wonderful time.
EC: So you were able to play your cowboy better than ever.
WP: Oh, absolutely. We'd go to Price once a month on a weekend to the show. We'd get maybe fifty cents, which was a lot of money, and we'd go to the show and have dinner. I remember one Chinese place where we ate three huge veal cutlets on the plate with vegetables, desert, drink, bread and all the ketchup
20

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 you needed for thirty-five cents. I remember those meals so well. They were so good.
EC: Now, in the company town I'm sure they had a company store. Your parents were never paid in script so it wasn't that restrictive living in the company town.
WP: We weren't because we were above that. My mother was Scotch and we always had money. We could go and spend our money wherever we wanted to. Now the miners, who lived from pay day to pay day, very often had to use the company script. They'd buy it and it would be taken out of their wages. Then they had to trade at the company store and the prices were much higher than they were in Price. But they ate pretty good.
EC: Company housing? WP: Yes, the company furnished the housing. I don't know
whether they paid rent or not. I doubt it. During the Depression I don't think anyone even paid rent. Of course they had coal stoves and they got their coal for nothing. EC: So, at Carbon High, you graduated when? WP: 1939. EC: Then what? WP: Well, I decided that I wanted to go to college but I had no idea where or why. As I say, there was no counseling. I decided that I would go to Utah State.
21

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 I went up there the first quarter and on registration day I went in and they said, "What do you want to major in." I didn't know what that meant. They said, "These are all the things that you can do." I looked them over and I thought that sounds good, radio engineering. I never had a radio in my life. I didn't know what radios were. But anyway that sounded good to me. So I was assigned my classes. The first day I went in this lab and the instructor put a bunch of things on the table in front of us and said, "Okay, by the end of this period I want you to have a crystal radio playing." Well, I didn't know what a crystal radio was. I didn't know what the stuff was that he put in front of us and I just looked around. (laughter) Well, needless to say, it was a disaster. I didn't know that you could change once you made a decision. After about a month I just quit. I didn't dare tell my parents and so I stayed there until the end of the quarter and then went home devastated. I was thoroughly convinced that I was a real dummy.
EC: Then there are those today who look upon counseling, and this sort of thing, as a frill.
WP: Yes. If someone would have just told me, just guided me just a little. My parents were not able to do that. They were not educated people, although they
22

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1
were very bright. My dad was a very bright person but he didn't know anything about education. So I went home. My brother-in-law was living in Santa Barbara, California, he was a service manager in a Buick g a r a g e t h e r e  He sa i d , " Com e on do wn and I ' 11 g i v e you a job greasing cars." So I went and that was a good education, a very good education for me. At that time in Santa Barbara Buicks were the big cars for the rich people. Many of these people would call in and say, "I want my car serviced." I would go out to their home and pick up the car. I always got along well with people. I knew how to talk and I became friendly with them. They liked me and I became friendly with them. A lot of stuff rubbed off on me as a result of that. I saw how they lived and what they did and so on. It made a big difference in what was going to happen to me later. I became somewhat sophisticated just from watching people. The war came at that time and the only time Japan ever bombed mainland United States was just outside of Santa Barbara, and I was there. A submarine surfaced and lobbed this thing on the beach. I think it hit an outhouse and then they submerged and ran away. Well, it was so funny, it really was funny. Even then it was funny because everyone panicked and there was a
23

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 mass exodus from California, really was. They sent word to get the Air Force out there to drop some depth charges. After about five days they got there. [laughter] If Japan wanted to, if they'd have been smart, they could have taken California any Sunday morning. Talk about unprepared.
EC: Did this event precede or follow the relocation camps for the Japanese.
WP: That relocation thing really hit me personally. I had a good friend, I told you about a Japanese g i r 1 on the bus, her sister when she graduated from Carbon moved to California and she was placed in one of these camps. She was a very nice girl. That hurt. More tragic was this fellow in Superior who was a great friend of the children. As a matter of fact I never saw him talk to an adult in my life that I can recall. And nobody wanted anything to do with him. He loved children and children loved him. He was an oriental gentleman. And we spent many hours with him. He would do things for us. He would make kites for us, he would make bird houses, although there were no birds in that town, but he would make bird houses. In the wintertime he would weave underwear for us. I never got cold up there. He was a wonderful old gentleman. He was a Korean. He made a great point of 24

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1
that. He spoke Korean-English. Maybe that's the reason adults didn't talk to him, because they didn't understand Korean-English. They understood Chinese and Japanese, but not Korean. I remember him telling over and over again that Korean culture was superior to both Japanese and Chinese. He felt very strongly about that. When we moved, I didn't think about it at the time, but after I started growing up I wondered what happened to him. We didn't even know his name. Everybody called him Snakey. I wondered, "What happened to Snakey." I worried about it bee ause as I was getting older I realized how much he meant to me. Somehow I wanted him to know that. After the war, the first thing I did while I was having trouble finding myself--! was searching for myself and I thought by going back to Superior maybe I would find out who I was because what I had become during the war was so different than everything that had gone before. Well anyhow, Superior was now a ghost town, but there were two old men who had run the pool hall while we were living there. They were still there. That was the only place that was open in Superior. So I drove into this old deserted town and I walked into this bar and saw these two old men and I told them who I was and they said, "Oh yeah, we remember your dad." So then I
25

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 asked the question that I was almost afraid to ask and I said, "What happened to Snakey?" And they said, "Well, they put him in the camps when they put these Japanese in the internment camps. He died very soon after.
EC: Even though he was Korean? WP: I said , "He wasn't Japanese, he was Korean!" I all
but shouted it. This one guy said, "What's the difference?" Ohhh, I'm afraid I cried. EC: You spoke o f your mi 1 it a r y ex per i en c e  What wa s it? The war broke out when you lived in Santa Barbara, so then what happened? WP: Yeah, I came back to Price and how it happened I don't know. How I heard about it I don't know. There was a competitive examination to be given and those who passed could become pilots. Not in cadets, not in the Army, but in something they called CPT, Civilian Pilot Training. The idea was to train pilots who would then go into different jobs, either instructors in Army primary, or pilots in air transport or various things. I didn't think I had a chance because there were only a few going to be taken. Matter of fact, I think in Carbon County there may have been only one or two. But these friends of mine said, "Let's take it any how. It won't hurt."
26

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 They were smart kids and one especially I thought was really very bright. So I thought, "Well, I'll just go along." I went and took it. I was the only one who passed it, which really surprised me. I couldn't believe it but nevertheless that was the way it was. So in this program you didn't have to have per feet health and vision. In this program you could go in if you had eyes correctable to twenty-twenty. I said, "If I can go get my eye doctor to say that he can correct my eyes will that be all right?" And he said, "Oh yes, that's okay." So I ran over and the doctor called in and said, "Yes, he was a friend of the fa mi 1 y . -n So an yh o w, I s t a r t e d in that pro g r am . It lasted two years and we went through--
EC: Where did you take your training? WP: Well, the first course was in Price at the airport
out there and the ground school was at the junior college. EC: Oh, for heaven sakes. WP: I was the only one, I think. There may have been two of us from Carbon County but the rest of them, there were about thirty-five or forty and they came from all parts of the United States. They were very bright kids, which later on began to puzzle me too because everywhere I went and in every program, I noticed
27

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 these kids were all sons of prominent people. I don't know whether I dare say this for the record, but it s e em e d to me that t hi s program was sort o f a draft dodging scheme. Well, it was okay with me. I had a wonderful time. These people with whom I was associating with were very well educated, and this is where I really got my education. They took me under their wing, this kid from the coal camps, and  accepted me as an equal. So I trained with them and played with them and had a wonderful time for two years and learned a great deal.
EC: Two years, you were in training for two years? WP: Yes. EC: Was the emphasis on navigation? WP: It was very comprehensive. The first was in primary,
just learning how to fly. The next was in what they call secondary, which was learning how to really fly. This was aerobatics and that sort of thing, so that ,you could take care of yourself under any conditions. The third program was cross country, where we learned navigation. The fourth program was in instrument training. We went to the Spartan School of Aeronautics, in Tulsa, which is still a fine school and was probably the best school in the United States at that time. I learned a great deal there. The fifth
28

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 was instructor training, where we learned to be instructors, and that was back in Nevada. It was an outstanding program and we were not under the military so we were free. We wore uniforms but we didn't have all those restrictions.
EC: What about ranks? WP: Well, we didn't have any rank. When we finished the
program we went to San Antonio and were to be commissioned 2nd Lieutenants.
EC: On.
WP: I went through all five programs and was on the train heading for San Antonio and they took us off the train, put us on siding and we sat there for two days. Then they took us to Denver's Buckley Field. There I found people from other programs around the country. There were only about five hundred of us in this program all over the United States. We all came to Buckley Field and we sat there, looking at each other. Finally someone came in and said, "The program i s term in at ed  Now you h av e the s e o p t ion s  You c an take your discharge and go home or you can go into some other phase of the air corps." Can you believe that?
EC: Never heard of it. WP: Out of those five hundred people, I think, there were
29

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 a few of us who stayed in and I was one of them. My brother had just been killed in Germany and it really hurt me. I thought I can't go home under those circumstances and so I went to mechanics school in Keisler Field, Mississippi and graduated from that and went to a factory school in Ypsilanti, Michigan, the Ford Factory School building B-24s. Then I went to gunnery school in Laredo, Texas and learned to become a gunner. I was a top turret gunner on a B-24 and then the war started !"unning down. They didn't know what to do with us. I went to B-29 school in Alamogordo. I was there when they dropped the first atom bomb. Then I went into troop carrier and all we were doing there was shuffling planes. Took a bunch of old C-47s down to Bogota, Colombia. They wanted to buy them and we shuffled them down there.
EC: By that time were you doing some piloting too?
WP: No, the only piloting I did after my program terminated was for Air Force pilots. During the war they had surveillance planes were which very slow fl y i n g wi t h h u g e wi n g s  The y wo u 1 d f 1 y t h em o v e r battlefields and direct artillery with them. Well, the pilots after the war stayed in because the money was good and they got flight pay. They hated to fly these planes because they were slow. 30

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 EC: Sitting ducks then. WP: So they hired me to fly them for them and then they'd
sign off that they had flown them. So I flew them. But that's the only flying I did after that. EC: Did you ever learn why the program was discontinued after spending two years training five hundred pilots? WP: No, I never learned why, except that we were no longer needed and the war was running down. Maybe it's true, I don't know. EC: Did you find this instructor training beneficial for your later experience? It was a good basic training on being an instructor wasn't it? WP: Yes, it was all good experience. I became a good pilot. Matter of fact that's one of the reasons I got along so well with my peers in my program. They were much more sophisticated people, college graduates and that sort of thing, but I was a better pilot than they were. They really respected that. So in a way it was a great prestige builder for me. I had a lot of fun. The places we went, we were taking secondary flight training in Independence, California, which is right next to Lone Pine, out there in the Mojave Desert. I remember one day a movie company came up there and they were shoot ing in our l it t l e town . It
31

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 was just a little, one motel town. I happened to walk in this place to have a cup of coffee one morning and there sat Ingrid Bergman. Of course I was always in love with Ingrid Bergman. And so I walked over and I told her, I said, "I can't help it but I love you." She was so cute, she was just really nice. So, she asked me to have breakfast with her. I had a movie actor as a roommate one time. What these people had to offer really rubbed off on me. In my ground school, which was really hard, there was physics and navigation and meteorology, that sort of thing on a high level. I'd never studied like this before in my life. These people helped me and I mastered it. I could work those hand computers as well as an yb od y else. It was a very good education.
EC: Did you put your flying ~ experience to use later on? WP: No, I became very disenchanted with flying because I
became a flight engineer as a result of all my other training. As I told you these pilots, there were thousands of them still in the Air Force and they had tG fly so much to qualify for flight pay. Well, as it turned out, there were only a couple of flight engineers on the base. They had to have an engineer go with them. So I was in the air all the time. I'd no sooner get home than I was back in the air. I got
32

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 so sick of it, so sick of flying that I swore I'd never get in another airplane. So I never did fly after that. Which is really funny. My son flies and he thinks it's crazy that I don't. He thinks it's the only thing to do. But I remember the month of May, 1946, I spent eighteen days, twenty-four hour days in the air. And it was too much.
EC: Point system to get out of the military. You had two years in this civilian flight training. That didn't ever count toward any military training or anything? Were you held in the military for some time after?
WP: I spent two years in the programs and two years in the Air Force.
EC: I see, so when did you-WP: I think they did count a portion of it. EC: When were you discharged then? WP: In May 1946. It was the last of May. EC: And then what happened to you? WP: Then, probably the most devastating part of my life.
Having come from that kind of environment for four years living with very sophisticated people, going in the fast lane and then coming home to nothing and still not knowing what I wanted to do. It was devastating. I went back to Price and worked in the coal mines.
33

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1
EC: Hum.
WP: I worked for a year in the mines and that was very
useful too. Matter of fact, if I had to choose one experience to say what was the most valuable to my career, as an educator, I would have to say the year I worked in the mine was the most valuable. EC: It seems a little incongruous, that kind of a thing. How do you translate that to life? WP: Well, it was dealing with people. I learned how to relate to people, but it was mainly the observations that I made in the mines that really changed the way I looked at the world. The fact that coal is found nundreds of feet beneath the earth's surface is one thing. And all these marine animals fossilized in that coal. And I was fascinated by those things. And the fascination grew as I went to college. So, all of these things played a very important role in my education. I would say before I went to college I got my education. When I went to college I sort of put the dressing on it. EC: In 1946, this is a period when John L. Lewis had the coal mines under his control and was very active with strikes and so on. Were you caught up in this or did you resist? Did you have to affiliate with the union down there? The miners? I forget what they called the
34

WILLIAM M. PURDY #1 union, do you remember?
WP: United Mine Workers of America. EC: That's right.

THIS IS TAPE #2 OF OUR FIRST INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM M. .PURDY AND WE ' RE REC0 RDI NG 0 N 0 CT0 BER 3 , 198 8  BI LL I S TELLING US ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCES AFTER HE RETURNED FROM THE MILITARY SERVICE IN WORLD WAR II AND HIS EMPLOYMENT IN THE COAL MINES IN PRICE, UTAH, OR CARBON COUNTY, UTAH.
WP: Yes, well, John L. Lewis was a very important person in my life. He was utterly despised by my father, who was in management. He and the superintendent were the only Republicans in our town and that caused me no end of trouble. I just figured my father knew everything, and he was a very wise person. If he thought the Republicans were right, then that must be the way it is. It caused me a lot of problems and my brother too. As a matter of fact the bus driver taking us home from school, stopped the bus and was going to actually beat up my brother because he said -something about Franklin Roosevelt in a derogatory way. I remember my father saying very clearly from the first election against Hoover right on up through Wilkie, that if Roosevelt wins this election, the country is through. We're going right down the drain. Of course, I thought that he was telling the truth, and we were in for trouble. It didn't happen. Then I began looking at my father in a little different way. By the time I was working in the coal mines I was a union man and I was a Democrat. My father didn't think much of me and I didn't think much of him. 36

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 Actually that's ?Ot entirely true. I still respected him a great deal, but I did not respect his politics. My mother, being a good Mormon woman, believed exactly like my father. I guess there are a few Mormon women who don't believe like their husbands, but I haven't run into very many. I told my mother at one time that if the Republicans ran a jack ass she'd vote for the jack-ass. She said, "Indeed I would." [laugh] Well, anyhow, it probably was because of John L. Lewis that I went to college because the strike was called in 1946. We didn't work for six months. I decided that just isn't the way to 1 i ve; when you're working six months and striking six months. So you've got to find something else to do. I enjoyed working in the mines. I went to Salt Lake. I thought, well, I'll go up to the University of Utah and see what the possibilities are. I came to the University of Utah and on registration day I suppose there are 20,000 people all trying to find something that they didn't understand.
EC: This is October '46. WP: I was completely disillusioned. I was so frightened
that I just knew that I could not cut it in this institution. I didn't know what to do. I talked to a friend of mine, a girl from Helper who was enrolled
37

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 at Westminster College. She said, "Come on up to Westminster. It's just a little school and everybody knows everybody and you' 11 love it." So I thought what the heck, I' 11 look at it. So I went up there and they were very friendly. I thought I would try it. I enrolled in Westminster.
EC: Did you have savings to pay for your tuition? WP: I had the GI Bill. EC: The GI Bill. WP: Right, I went on the GI Bill. My parents were living
in Salt Lake at that time so I lived with my mother. My father was dead by that time. Actually, it turned out to be a pretty good experience. The people who made up my class at Westminster were mostly returned service men who were a pretty bright group of people. Many of the faculty at that time were also returned service men who were looking for their niche and decided they could teach at Westminster for a year or two until they could find something better. We had a pretty good staff there. EC: Who was the president at this time? WP: David Steele. Jesse Bouten was the Dean of the school. Jesse Bouten was an intellectual from Colgate. He was a Doctor of Philosophy, his major as Philosophy. He was a very bright guy. Under his
38

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 guidance, things went pretty well for me. I decided that I'd get this over with as quickly as possible. From my ground school experience I got several credits. I came up here to the University during the summer  So I grad u at e d in three year s . I started in the fall of '47 and finished in 1950. I did quite well.
EC: What was your major? WP: My major was history with a minor in English. What I
had decided at that time was that I was going to be a great writer. This is sort of from my father who wanted to do the same thing. He always thought he would be a great writer if he ever had time to do it and didn't have a headache all the time. He always had headaches. Anyhow I got the idea. I looked around, where does one go if one wants to be a writer? Either someone told me or it was in the literature that the University of Missouri was the place to go. So I wrote and I told them that I wanted to be a writer and asked if I could come. They wrote back and said, "You go to a liberal arts college someplace for four years, get your degree, then if you still want to be a writer, then you come." So I thought, okay. They said, "Major in English, minor in History or the other way, either one." So I
39

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 decided well, okay, I' 11 major in history and minor in English which I did. Then in the beginning of my senior year, this fellow comes along who's head of the education department at Westminster. He said, "Don't you want to get a teaching certificate?" I s a i d , "Why wo u 1 d I want to do that ? " He s a i d , " I t ' s great insurance, great insurance. You always have a job." He says, "All you've got to do is take a few classes and go do some practice teaching and you' 11 have it. As a matter of fact I need somebody right now. Even before you take your classes I want you to do your practice teaching." So I said, "Okay." So he sent me down to West High School. At West High I had a class designed for students who just couldn't cut it any place. You can imagine, the class was called occupations. I didn't even know what it was, but the instructor took me into the class and introduced me. Said, "This is going to be your teacher for the next four or five months." It was for a full semester, I remember. I never saw him again.
EC: He was your supervisor. WP: Yes , my super v is or . But sweet are the uses of
adversity. Because of that I learned a great deal about how to handle kids. Because I had to do it, I couldn't ask somebody else to do it. After awhile, I
40

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2
could see they were so bored and I was very wishy-
washy. I got tough, I said, "This is the way we're
going to do it and I don't care if you like it or not. Some guy wised off and I said to them, "You can go out in the back of the gymnasium here, if you want to take me on, take me on. You and all your friends altogether, I don't care. But we're going to decide who's running this class right now. Now do you want to go or do you want to stay." The bluff worked! They decided, well, he's a pretty good guy. So I got through that class okay. It really helped me later on, when I had difficult kids to deal with, I knew how to deal with them. It was a good experience. So I got my certificate. EC: I was thinking with your background in mining and your military and so on,; you had a good feel for the kind of kids that you must have picked down on the Westside. WP: Yeah, I could tell them that I'd throw them out the window and they would believe me because I meant it! I' 11 never forget, after I started teaching, we had this new teacher and he had a terrible time. He was such a sweet person, he couldn't be angry with anyone. These kids just ate him alive. He asked me, "How do you do it? What do you do if somebody says a
41

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 dirty word or something?" I said, "I just throw 'em out the window!" [laugh] Well, it was two or three days later I saw about three of these kids throwing this teacher right out the door. They had him by the pants and they just ran him right out the door. That made me feel bad, but everyone's different.
EC: After three years at Westminster you end up with a degree and your teaching certificate?
WP: Right. EC: Then did you continue to pursue your writing career
here at the University? WP: No, I didn't. I became fascinated with history. I
decided that I wanted to do something along that line and at least get more information. So I went to work at Kennecott, out at the mill in Magna. I worked night shift and I went to the university during the day. It was good. I really liked that experience, it was really good. Emil Lucki I remember as an exceptional teacher, I really liked him. I took several classes from him. EC: Leland Creer was another. WP: Leland was the enigma. Leland could be the best and the worst. If he liked what he was doing he was a good teacher, I enjoyed his classes. If he didn't like what he was doing, boy, could he make it
42

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 miserable. I was old enough that I could talk back to him. I had one class with him that was so bad that I finally told him, "They don't pay me enough to sit through this misery." I said, "I'm not going to take this class." He felt kind of bad. He said, "Oh come on, stick it out."
EC: Was it his class in Historiography? WP: Yes, it was. EC: Oh yes. WP: Historiography! Oh, it was terrible. He felt kind of
bad but I went in there and I said I'm not going to sit there. So I left. EC: For some reason or another I associate you with Jess Jennings. Did you have classes with him? Did you come under his influence? WP: While I was teaching, the National Science Foundation, sponsored several programs. I got in a couple of those programs, one in anthropology and one in geology here at the University. Although I didn't take classes from Jess, I knew him because I taught his kids. When he was doing the upper-Colorado River thing, he wanted to do a dig in Boulder, Utah which was not in the reservoir area, so the money was not a v a i 1 a b 1 e . I to 1 d him to take some kid s from St . Marks, "We'll do the digging, do all the work, you
43

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 just have somebody there to tell us what we're doing. That's all the pay we want, I want those kids to know what they're doing." He says, "Great." So we went down there for two weeks and we dug that sight and did a beautiful job. We had about two tons of artifacts that are here at the University someplace that we took . out of there.
EC: Fremont culture was it? WP: Yes. Jesse wanted to see how it coordinated with the
reservoir sites. It was a great experience. EC: I remember your involvement in the Flaming Gorge
sights. WP: Yes, and as a result of that Jesse gave me the job of
doing the initial archeological survey of the Flaming Gorge. EC: 1962 WP: Yes, something 1 ike that. So I spent a summer doing that. That resulted in the publication of anthropological paper number thirty-eight. It was fun. When I went to Manila, I went there to do research for a masters degree in history. EC: Under Lee Creer? WP: Lee Creer. I'd already taken him out there once to Browns Park . He was rea 11 y ex c i t e d abo u t it and I said, "I'd like to do a dissertation on Northeastern
44

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 Utah, Southwestern Wyoming." He said, "Wonderful, wonderful." He was so excited. It was the only part of Utah that he didn't know. He said, "You've got to move out there, that's the only way you can do it is move out there." I said, "Well, okay I' 11 move out there." I said, "I'll need a committee or something." he said, "I'm your committee, just go." [laugh]
EC: Sounds like Leland Creer. WP: So I went. I got a job teaching in Manila and I
s t a r t e d my r e s e a -r c h , b u t I c o u 1 d n ' t s o l v e t h e probl-em. I 1 earned a great deal about oral history then, especially people who live in isolated places like that. They're very earnest in what they tell you. What they tell you is what they dream, not what they know. Every time I tried to pin something down, it fell apart. Everyone was dishonest, not by design but simply because they told me stories about things the way they wanted to remember them, The way they wished they had been. Kerry Born is the perfect example of that. All of his history is written from that stand point. "This is the way it must have been because this is the way I wanted it to be." EC: The story of the Rhodes mine is a good example. WP: Oh, absolutely, it's all hogwash. But you know, it fills a need for the person writing it. I found this
45

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 everywhere I went. I went over to Craig, Colorado. It was their centennial and they published this beautiful document about the history of that county for a hundred years. It was amazing, they had Escalante and his trek originating in Monterey. He had gone into Browns Hole and Davey Crockett had gone through there and ---[laugh]
EC: At least his ghost huh!? WP: I just had to laugh as I read this stuff. But these
old people who wrote it were very serious and they thought they were doing a wonderful thing by recording the history of this county. Well, you find the same thing in Burroughs book to a lesser extent but it's the same thing. He talks about Browns Hole being a great trapper's rendezvous. I don't know of any rendezvous that was ever held in Browns Park. There were trappers there and they would come in to trade but there was never a rendezvous there that I knew of. But he said that it was the greatest rendezvous spot in the whole country. EC: Coming back to your experiences there in the school, now when you went to Manila, what was the school like? Did you have a high school? How many teachers did you have? What was your student body? What was it like in this isolated community?
46

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 WP: Well, it's difficult to describe because it's hard
for me to believe it even though I went through it. It's still hard to believe. That school had grades one through twelve. As I recall we had ninety-four students in the twelve grades. Several of these students were from Wyoming because the boundary line is right there and there are many ranches that are adjacent to the boundary. I guess they had some kind of deal with Sweetwater County, Wyoming where they would send their children to school in Manila. We had six teachers. Three in elementary and three in high school. Taught all the subjects. I went out there and taught history, geography, typing, P.E. and English, I think it was. I didn't know how to type, but I was the type teacher. Strange as it  may seem, those kids were typing by the end of the year. They were typing seventy words a minute. Typing is an easy thing to teach, even if YQU don't know how. That's one place where text books really tell you what to do. So I just followed the text and kids learned. EC: Now you said six teachers. What about the superintendent? Where did he fit in? And Principal? WP: Well, when I went out there the superintendent was the principal and he did not teach. I think he taught previous to the time I went out there. They were
47

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 getting sophisticated, you know, so he didn't teach. I don't know what he did! But anyhow, at the end of that first year he resigned. They hired a new superintendent, who didn't come out to check out the place until August of the following year. He wanted to know where you ski. When I told him there's no place to ski in Manila, he went back to Salt Lake and sent his letter of resignation. School was about to start, we had no superintendent, so the board came to me and said, "Well, you're it. We'll give you a try." There wasn't anybody else coming back, I was the only one coming back.
EC: You had been there one year? WP: Yes, I was the first teacher for I don't know how
many years to stay more than one year. So I was the only one. Naturally I got to be superintendent. But they said, "We' 11 evaluate what you're doing at Christmas time and if you're doing a good job then we' 11 give you a raise to $3000.00 a year." I was making $2600.00. EC: That was pretty good pay at that time. WP: Well, it wasn't bad. I imagine it was about the same a s t h e y we r e ma k i n g h e r e . I s a i d , " 0 k a y . '' So a t Christmas time I went to them and I said, "Okay, am I your superintendent now on a permanent basis?" They
48

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 said, "Yes." I said,"Okay." Well, payday came and I
didn't get any money. So I went back and I said ,
"This is the way I understand it, I get paid $3000.00 a year for this year if I'm accepted." They said, "Oh no, we' 11 give you $2600 for up until Christmas and then we'll start paying you." I said, "No, you can't do that." I said, "I've been doing the work, I deserve the pay." Well, they thought about that and finally they relented and I got to be superintendent. EC: Somewhere along the line, while you've not specifically stated, you shed your Mormon background. Well, not the background but your commitment to the Mormonism. WP: Yes. EC: Now when you went back there was this largely a Mormon community and how did you now fit in? WP: Yes, that's a good quest ion. I had wrestled with my church affiliation during my stay in the service. That's when it really came to a head. I read the Book of Mormon and I asked the Lord for guidance and all this kind of stuff and it didn't come. The missionaries have a very difficult time believing that because they said, "It says right here if you do it, you'll get the answer." Well, I didn't get the answer. I wasn't antagonistic against the Church, it
49

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 was just that I didn't have any talent for religion, period. So why bother about it, just admit it and that's what I did.
EC: So it wasn't an attraction to another organized religion?
WP: No, I don't belong to any church. I went to St. Marks which was an Episcopal school. We had Episcopal services there which I learned  to enjoy. As a matter of fact I enjoyed the Episcopal church more than I did the Mormon church. It had a lot more substance to it, so it seemed to me. A lot more nice things in their liturgy. It .gave you something to think about and to feel good about, even in the poetry. It just made you feel good. I enjoyed that. It didn't bother me, but I didn't reach the point where I wanted to join the church.
EC: So when you went into a Mormon community there in Manila how did this work out?
WP: Well, today if I had done that, I probably wouldn't have lasted one week. When I went there, it was not a Mormon community per se. Mormons were different there. Manila Mormons were unlike any Mormons I've ever known. They just were not traditional Mormons. Ma n톦 1 i v e d very much 1 ike other p eo p 1 e  The y d r an k coffee and smoked cigarettes and drank whiskey and so 50

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 on and so forth.
EC: Obeying the word of Wisdom was not the badge of conformity?
WP: No, the Word of Wisdom was not a big thing out there. Of course, they were only about fifty percent of the population too. The other fifty percent were left overs from the fur trading days and the people who went into homesteading. All along Henry's Fork there were people who set up homesteads. They were old mountain men like Jack Robinson who was with Bridger. I can't remember the names.
EC: I've heard you talk about some people out there. There are some who stand out in your memory as being substantial citizens. Dean Smith, did you know him personally?
WP: Oh yes. His name is Keith Smith. Keith Smith was a very extraordinary man. His father, as a present for graduating from Yale University in 1905, gave him a safari. He called it a safari to the Uinta Mountains. He spent the summer hunting, bear, deer, elk and whatever. Keith just fell in love with the country. He looked it over, he especially liked the Sheep Creek Canyon, where it runs into the Green River. It's part of the Flaming Gorge, and it's beautiful country. He decided to stay there and he built a 51

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 canal using the water from Sheep Creek to go down on the Red Bench. It wouldn't hold water. After all that trouble he had to give it up. So he went over to Lynnwood and built himself a ranch and went into the cattle business and the sheep business.
EC: Was this undertaken by homestead methods or did he purchase it? Do you recall?
WP: I think he probably was a homesteader but I am not positive about that. He was an English gentleman. I mean his family was British. Although they were Am e r i c an s they s p en t t h e i r t i me in Vi r g in i a . Wh en they were not in Virginia they were with the British army someplace. His father had been in the army in England in the colonial forces. Keith spent time with the army in Egypt and India. But he spent a lot of his time in Virginia.
THIS IS SIDE TWO OF OUR SECOND TAPE OF OUR INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM M. PURDY. TODAY OCTOBER 3,1988. BILL IS TELLING US ABOUT SOME OF HIS EXPERIENCES OUT IN DAGGETT COUNTY AND SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS HE BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH, NAMELY KEITH SMITH.
WP: Now Keith did stay in the country. That was his residence, although he was never accepted there as a citizen of Daggett County. He lived there. During the depression, the people of that county literally lived 52

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 off that man. They would steal from him and he knew it. He let them steal sheep and cattle, so long as they didn't take too many. So they 1 iked him. They got along with him and they didn't abuse him. He was very smart, being a Yale man. When Mountain Fuel was opening gas wells in Clay Basin; he went over there and made a claim on some of those and got them. So for his entire life, he was paid, I don't know how many hundred dollars a month, for the use of those wells. That's where he got his wealth really. He n e v e r hurt for money . When I went to the s c ho o 1 in Manila, the first thing I did was walk into the library in Manila High School to see what it was 1 ike . We 11 , Keith Smith had don ate d his person a 1 library to the school. There wasn't a volume in that library that hadn't been donated by Keith Smith. [tape turned off temporarily.]
EC: Now you were talking about Keith Smith donating his library to the school there in Manila. What did it consist of, what was it like?
WP: Well, it was a classical library and all of the books were published previous to 1900. They were wonderful books and I spent a lot of time drooling over them. No one else ever read them, student's never picked them up. You know you can't blame them. So that was
53

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 the library. During that year I was superintendent, I thought, I'm really going to make a difference in this county. So I fudged here and there and I saved $10,000. I told the board I was going to spend it on a library for the school. We were going to spend $10,000 on books. Well, I came to Salt Lake for a meeting and when I got back, the board had called a meeting and they gave the $10,000 back to the county. I was furious. By that time I was getting into the ' spirit of that county and how people operated. So it didn't really trouble me that long.
EC: Let me interrupt here . Here ' s Keith Smith , a very well educated man, gentleman and so on. How was he accepted in the community and did he play a leadership role at all?
WP: No , I wo u 1 d say he did not . I don' t know the particulars but I doubt that he was invited to run for the school board, for instance. He was an outsider. You just didn't become friendly with people like Keith Smith. Although you accepted them and you took advantage of them and all of this; they were still outsiders and they were not privy to the problems you felt.
EC: Yet, he was elected to the Utah state legislature as a Senator and both his daughters served there. Which
54

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 is rather unique in Utah.
WP: Well, I can understand that a little. A state job is something that they felt Keith could do. As a matter of fact they were getting him out of the county. Wouldn't harm Daggett County any. So, it did give them a source of pride that one of their people were there. I never saw him exert himself in the community at all. Which is interesting, I hadn't thought about that.
EC: I know from reading the county history, he tried various things. At one time he was operating a hog ranch out there wasn't he?
WP: Yes. EC: Seems a little unusual as far as he was from the
market. So in some sense it seemed to me that he was almost a dreamer too. WP: Yes, I think he was. He tried all kinds of things and he had the backing of his family. I think it was his brother who established the banana plantations in Guatemala. I know Keith went there to borrow money one time and had a difficult time getting out of there. He's a fascinating story. EC: Let's stop here today Bill and then let's pick up later. I want you to talk about some of the other people of Daggett County, the Krauses and some of the
55

WILLIAM M. PURDY #2 other people that played a prominent role. Part of it in mythology as much as actuality. So let's do that next time. [END OF SIDE TWO, TAPE TWO]
56

TODAY IS OCTOBER 12, 1988, AND THIS IS OUR SECOND INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM M. PURDY, FORMER HEAD MASTER OF ROWLAND HALL AND ST. MARK'S SCHOOL AND WE'RE RECORDING IN THE MARRIOTT LIBRARY AND THIS IS PART OF THE COOLEY ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM. [E. L. COOLEY IS THE INTERVIEWER. TAPE
113]
EC: Today we want to pick up where we left off with the last interview. Bill, if you' 11 maybe comment about some of the other people that you became acquainted with in Daggett County, your experiences up there as school superintendent and teacher. Now you did make men t ion of Ke it h Smith , but wa s n ' t t h i s k i nd o f a unique family for the area?
WP: Yes, they were very unique. They were never considered to be typical residents. The children were not educated in Daggett County. They were all sent to Virginia to be educated. They had two daughters, one became a school teacher who taught in a private school in Virginia for many years. She was a fine artist. The othef daughter married John Hay who owns the First National Bank in Rock Springs and is a big sheep man. There is one son, Keith Jr., who is a dentist. I don't know Keith Jr., but I have met him. He lives here in Salt Lake City. They had very little direct contact in the county.
EC: Is that so? How come then that Keith was elected to the state legislature as a senator, and then he was
57

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 followed by two daughters which is a unique experience for the State of Utah. That a man and two daughters would both be elected to the legislature.
WP: Well, that's not too unusual for that particular place. Here is a county with fewer than three hundred people in it. They are almost entirely ranchers, and they are not a formally educated people. They do not want to be embarrassed by assuming that they can do a job like being a legislator. So they would send a person like Keith or his daughters or Heber Bennion to the legislature because these people were educated. They were bright, they did have the county's interest at heart, and the people in the county had pride in them. I don't think that's very unusual. There were so few people who were qualified other than these people. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any.
EC: What about in the school system? Did you have any lac al pea ple who bee arne teachers, principals and so on or were they like you, outsiders coming in?
WP: There were no local people in the schools. One girl did marry a rancher out there, and she continued to teach for a few years. Now she's just part of that community. I think today they may have one who's working on certifying to become a teacher, but who is 58

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 teaching mainly because they can't find anyone else.
EC: Now you mentioned Heber Bennion . What about his family? I became acquainted with his daughter. I've forgotten her name now, but she married someone in the Foreign Service. She's traveled the world and so on.
WP: Yes. They're a very industrious family. That girl that you're talking about is one of the most beautiful women that I've ever seen. She was really a very striking woman, highly educated and well traveled.
EC: Heber Bennion was almost as absentee landlord, wasn't he, because--
WP: Oh yes. EC: --he was secretary of state here. WP: That's right. I don't know that he ever lived out
there, although he did maintain a ranch. He had hired help running the ranch. They would come out occasionally and supervise what was going on, but he was an absentee landlord. EC: Now, I have not read the books that have been written about the area and particularly about Brown's Hole which gets into Daggett County. But the county has quite a reputation as being rough and tough. I suppose part of this stems from the movies and the
59

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 Charlie Kelly and Burroughs tales of the strong hold of the bad men. Did this carry over into Daggett as you knew it, or was this just part of the myth and legends of the area?
WP: Yes, it did carry over. Brown's Hole became famous as an outlaw hideout because the ranchers who lived there did not interfere with the outlaw groups who came in. They didn't bother them. They were on friendly terms and no one wanted difficulties. So this was acceptable to both sides, and they could survive that way. I found that Daggett County was very much the same in that there was little law in Daggett County. I mean you did just about whatever you pleased. I mean you might go overboard sometime, but I don't know of anyone ever being cited for doing anything wrong. It was just understood that people were human beings and that they would make mistakes. That's okay so long as they didn't go too far. So during the Depression people were stealing livestock from Keith Smith and he knew it. He accepted it as his social responsibility to keep people alive out there. As long as they didn't steal too much, it was all right.
EC: To bear this out, I remember hearing Hugh Colton tell about trying to prosecute Josie Morris who was a 60

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 resident at times up in Brown's Park for stealing cattle and butchering the cattle from the Chew family ranch.
WP: Yes. EC: And she just ignored the law, and if she were hauled
into court, nothing would happen. WP: Well, if you go into court in those days in
communities like that, it was just a forgone conclusion that cattle owners would never win a case. Where would they get the jurors to try such a case? They were all sympathetic with people 1ike the poor ranchers and the homesteaders because they made up the majority. The cattle owners were absentee people largely. They all had hired help. Most of the big cattle c톙mpanies were owned by people in Great Britain, or Boston, or someplace, but very few of them were Westerners. EC: There's this element of the lawless people in the area. In Burrough's book and Charlie Kelly's has the picture been over drawn? WP: I think they got a little bit carried away with the romance of the Old West. It really wasn't that way. You can't help but get carried away with it, I find that I get carried away with it too. In that kind of environment, you just get caught up in it. There is
61

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 something awfully romantic about the Old West but most of it isn't true. If we could really see it objectively the way it was, it would be far different than the way it's been portrayed.
EC: Did you know any of the family members of some of these old lawless element like the Ewings, Krause, or any of those families?
WP: Minnie Krause was the only member of that family that I knew. She became a very respectable lady when she married George Rasmussen who became the proprietor of the store in Lynnwood. I did get into her confidence. We became very good friends after several years, and I nurtured her because I knew that she probably held the key to a lot of the questions that I had. She finally got to the point where she could talk to me openly. I learned quite a few things behind the scene that sort of speak about her family and especially her father. I have no way of proving it, because there is no documentation, but I really think that Charlie Krause could have been the "king pin" behind the whole thing. I think when Butch Cassidy went into Brown's Hole, he reported to Charlie Krause. They were always there. They spent all their money playing poker whenever they spent two or three months there. It was just one big poker game. 62

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 EC: Minnie Krause wouldn't substantiate this opinion of
yours? WP: Well, she admitted that everything that I suggested
might be true, but she really didn't know. She finally said, "Well, maybe you're right," you know. [laughter] EC: You weren't influenced to the extent that you wanted to spend your life in Daggett County even as superintendent of schools? WP: No. Although I found something there that was quite precious. I enjoyed it. I had other things about myself that needed nurturing too. Being away from the city, especially being so far out in the country, left too many voids. After awhile we decided that we really had to get back to the city. EC: When you came back to the city, why did you go to a private school? What was the influence there to bring you to Rowland Hall-St. Mark's? WP: Well Everett, all my life I've been very lucky. I have just been in the right place at the right time, just countless times. I just can't attribute it to anything but just plain luck. When I was going to college here, I supported myself and my family by installing sprinkling systems. Now, you know your colleagues up here at the university? Iver Bradley
63

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 and Mark Kessler?
EC: Yes. WP: Well, I worked for them. EC: I hadn't realized that. WP: Yes, they're good friends of mine and I worked for
them several years. While I was doing that we received an assignment to put in a sprinkling system on Second Avenue and B Street. In the process, I wondered: "What is this place?" A gentleman came by, and I asked him. He said, "It's a school." I said, "What kind o f a s c ho o 1 ? " And he sa i d , " We 11 , it ' s a private school for boys." And I said, "Oh!" Well, I'd heard of Rowland Hall, but this was not part of Rowland Hall at that time. This was called St. Mark's School. It was being started by Jim Hogle who was really the one behind it. He had sons coming up and he wanted them to have a place to go to school. He had received this kind of an education himself. I think he went to St. Pauls. But anyhow, the bishop was very anxious to establish a school for boys. EC: This is the Episcopal Bishop for Utah? WP: Yes, the Episcopal Bishop of Utah who's name was Richard Watson. Well, I was very curious of course. Here's a private school just getting started. This was 1956 and I was teaching in the Salt Lake system.
64

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 I'd had quite a bit of success. I was teaching on the West Side in a junior high school which everyone thought was a rough school. Well, I didn't find it difficult at all. I was lucky again in my experience in the coal mines and that sort of thing.
EC: At Superior _and life in Carbon County? WP: Yeah, I had an attitude that the kids could
understand and relate to. I didn't have any difficulty with these tough kids. As a matter of fact, we got along very well. I know at Jackson Junior High School, on almost every other weekend, the students would get in that school and just demolish the place. They loved it when crates of eggs were delivered. They would take these eggs and just plaster the school. They never touched my room, which I thought was really interesting and so did everyone else. But anyhow, I was a little frustrated in that school because I had forty students in each class, and I had six classes in a day. Six periods in a day, forty students in each class and that is impossible. ED: Burnout comes easily. WP: I don't care how good you are, you can't sustain much interest under those conditions; although, I did a pretty good job. The thing that frustrated me most was that I couldn't do what I wanted to do most, that
65

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 was to get people to write. With over two hundred students, to read even one page was a major undertaking. I was tired after school. I also had to work a job after school to keep things going. That was very frustrating to me, that I really couldn't teach the way I wanted to. So talking to this man up at St. Mark's I asked him, "How many students are you going to have up here?" He said, "Well, the first year we' 11 have grades seven through nine and we' 11 add a grade each year until we get through grade twelve. We' 11 average about from eight to ten students per class." Eight to ten? Wow! So I said, "Well, do you need any teachers?" He looked at me and said, "Well, I like to get my teachers from New England." [laughter] I said, "All right, but is there anything against making an application, even if you won't consider me. There just might be a chance you know that ... " And he said, "No, if you want to make an application, that's fine," He said, "I have found that people educated west of the Mississippi are just a little ... " [laughter] Well, I thought maybe he's right. Maybe he's right. But anyhow, I made an application. Well, this is the summertime. Now, private schools, if they don't have their teachers by April for the following year they're in trouble. I 66

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 didn't know that then, but I know it now. He couldn't find anyone.
EC: Was there a salary difference between the private school?
WP: At that time they were about the same. EC: I see. WP: Yes, but it didn't take long for the differential to
grow. As a matter of fact, that is the reason that I left St. Mark's. I left there at one time. EC: Oh, I wasn't aware of that. WP: When he finally decided that I was better than nothing, he hired me. He told me when he hired me that if I were successful I could count on a salary equivalent to my counterpart in the public schools in Salt Lake City. I said, "That's fair." So, I worked there two years and I was almost too successful. It was a little embarrassing for him, the headmaster, because he was also teaching at that time.  I don't know why, but I had the most popular classes in the s c hoo1 , and I had t rem end o us rapport with both students and parents. I think they understood me. Westerners understand Westerners and they sometimes have a hard-time with Easterners. Well anyhow, on the third year, I was offered a contract. The public school had gotten a really good raise that year and I
67

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 didn't. So, I reminded him about our contract, although it was an oral agreement. He got very angry and said, "Take it or leave it." So I said, "Okay. I'll leave it." So I left and went back to Daggett County. [laugh]
EC: I wasn't aware of that. WP: Yes, I went back there as the principal. They now had
both a superintendent and a principal. So the fellow that I made superintendent out there made me principal, but that didn't last long either. I had enjoyed teaching at St. Mark's. It was the highlight of my whole life. I've never had such a beautiful experience. I had bright kids and all they needed was somebody to guide and push. That first class, I remember, they graduated in 1960. In that class fourteen kids graduated and out of those fourteen we had eight students that had combined SATs of over thirteen hundred. A lot of them were going to Ivy League schools or Stanford or Berkeley--extremely bright kids. They were so much fun to teach because they were bright and they wanted to learn. You know they loved history. EC: You had an opportunity to do things there, because of the size, that in public schools you were not permitted to do. For instance, I remember your
68

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 bringing your students to the Utah State Historical Society to do research projects that you never could have done with forty kids at Jackson or wherever.
WP: That's right. I could take that class in my car, almost, and that makes a lot of difference. We could do a lot of things. I got into field studies--maybe the best thing that I did--because I learned how to do that. I really learned how to conduct field studies and the kids loved it. You have to be inventive and so I made myself a summer job by doing historical tours in the West. We did a lot of things that you would have been impossible with large classes. The kids really liked that. We'd go to Taos and we'd go on the Oregon Trail.
EC: Was this sponsored by the school or was this independent from the school?
WP: No, I did it myself, but I had lots of backing. I mean everybody backed me, especially the school, and the board was very kind to me.
EC: Let me ask a question. To what extent was this school sponsored, supported, funded at all by the Episcopal Church?
WP: Well, as far as I know, Everett, the school was never funded by the Episcopal Church in modern times. They did found the school. It was started by them in 1880. 69

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 The Episcopal Church had a very fine missionary system out in the West and they established a lot of schools. They established several schools in Utah.
EC: Particularly in Utah. WP: Yes. EC: Christianized the Mormons and educated them too.
[Laughter] WP: Right. They felt that they had quite a responsibility
there. I think that it was really good for Utah. Well anyhow, this one stuck. Rowland Hall started out as a co-educational school. As a matter of fact, I think it was called St. Mark's, at first, and then it developed into the girls school. That girls school has run continuously ever since. It's the oldest school in Salt Lake City. EC: Were you ever aware of any examination of potential teachers for religious affiliation or background? Was there any test? WP: There's none that I know of. I'm a perfect example how a person like me could become headmaster of an Episcopal school! It's unheard of. Nobody asked me about my religion and so I didn't tell them. [laughter] We got along fine. I was there for twentyfive years and no one ever asked me. I think that answers your question.
70

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 EC: So you went out to Daggett County and then you came
back to St. Mark's. When was that?
WP: I left in '58 and I came back in '60.
EC: Now did that headmaster who had given you the contract leave?
WP: No, he's the one who got me back. EC: I see. WP: Which made me feel very good because I remained very
fond of this man. EC: Was it because of some of the pressure of the parents
who wanted a good teacher back? WP: I don't know, but he was anxious to have me back
which made me feel very good. I think that he recognized that I, for some reason, did offer a dimension in that school that was absent when I was absent. I knew that I was valuable to that school. As it turned out, so did everybody else because subsequently a lot of things happened. I became headmaster of the school, and that should never have happened, really. If you just look at the paper work, why I should never have become headmaster. EC: Did you have to take educational administrative courses? WP: Well, you're supposed to, Everett, but I didn't. EC: You didn't? So this was unusual.
71

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 WP: Yes, and it's unusual because I worked very closely
with the accreditation organization. I was a member of the Northwest Committee for twelve years. As a matter of fact, Joyce Hanson, one of my best supporters is a close friend. I did a lot for her and she did a lot for me. So, it was a mutual thing. I think it was good for Utah schools for me to be there. EC: Now, Rowland Hall and St. Mark's were eventually combined? WP: That's right. EC: When did this occur? What were the circumstances that brought that about? WP: Well, they were very unhappy circumstances. It's almost hard to talk about it. There were so many things that pulled you apart. The gentleman who was the headmaster of St. Mark's was eased out. The head mistress of Rowland Hall (and there we were right adjacent to each other on the same block) these two people did not get along very well. As a matter of fact, they didn't talk to each other except on the telephone. As a teacher at St. Mark's, I wouldn't dare go to socialize at Rowland Hall. That just wasn't done if you wanted to stay at St. Mark's. Teachers who did go were not in very good favor with
72

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3
the headmaster. Well, through the politics of the thing, he was eased out on the pretence that they should be combined for economy's sake and that sort of thing. So the head mistress became the head of both schools. It was a sad thing. I didn't know quite what to do, per son ally, about it. I told the headmaster that I would resign and he asked me not to. So I decided to honor his request and stay on. He said, "Somebody has to look after the boys and you're it." I felt strongly about that too. Well, as it turned out, the lady, who was the head of Rowland Hall and became head of the school, treated me very well. We got along beautifully. Right in the beginning we did have a session where we made our points, so that it was clear to the other how things were going to operate. I'll give her credit, she allowed me the freedom to do my job. As a matter of fact, she encouraged me to take on more. I became Dean of Students and college counselor. Now, you remember the wonderful '60s? I mean they're horrible in some ways, but talk of money for education! It was wonderful. There was money everywhere. I guess we can thank the Russians for that. Like the National Science Foundation's support of various universities. They were all offering things to teachers and it was
73

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 wonderful. I got in college counseling just at the right time because colleges were looking for good students and they had a lot of money. I was invited to spend a week at MIT, at Boston University, at Princeton, at several schools in Maine and then all over, not just in New England. I went to Washington University in St. Louis for a week. I went to St. Johns and spent six weeks in the Northwest visiting all the colleges in the Northwest. Well, that was wonderful for me and for my students. [END OF SIDE ONE OF TAPE]
EC: This is side two of tape number one of our second interview with William M. Purdy. Today is October the 12th. Mr. Purdy is telling us about his experiences at St. Mark's School, particular during the '60s.
WP: As I was saying, Everett, the colleges had ample funds and they wanted students and they wanted college counselors in the schools to know about their colleges. So it was wonderful for those of us who were in that business. I got to know these schools individually and I could match them with students. I think every school that I visited, we sent kids to, and they all loved it. So it did really work. Some of the benefits you'd never dream of. St. Johns--
EC: In Baltimore?

WP: No, they have two campuses. They have a campus in Baltimore and they have one in Santa Fe.
EC: Oh! WP: The same school. They have the same curriculum and
everything, but I was visiting the one in Santa Fe. I have never been so enchanted by a college as I was St. Johns. They have the classical curriculum, the students all take the same classes. They don't have electives, everyone studies the same curriculum which I think has some real benefits. They had very small classrooms. They have about ten to fifteen students in a class and they sat around a table. They had teachers that were called tutors. Very often in visiting those classes, I wouldn't be able to tell who the teacher was, which I thought was kind of interesting. I prolonged my stay there for a full week because I was so enchanted with the place. I came away thinking that what they were doing I could do at Rowland Hall-St. Mark's. So almost immediately after that we built a new classroom building. In that building, I had the same people make the same tables that were used in Santa Fe because they were so beautiful. They were conference type maple tables. I can't remember the size but eighteen people could sit around the table. They were trapezoidal on the ends
75

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 which made everyone visible. It was amazing what happens when you study around a table like that. It puts a whole new meaning on homework, for instance. If you don't do your homework, you come to class and you look like a jackass. One thing kids don't like is to be humiliated because they don't know something that they should know. So they started doing their homework. You have an assignment and then you come to class and you discuss it, and it worked beautifully.
EC: That is possible with smaller classes? WP: Yes, fifteen is ideal. If you get more than fifteen,
it starts breaking down, if you get fewer than f i f t e en , i t s t a r t s b r e a k i n g down . When you get to twenty-five, it's gone; when you get to five, it's gone. If you could have classrooms at fifteen students, you really could teach school. So many people don't understand those things. I just read an article in the Holiday Magazine by a very dear friend of mine, Joe Rosenblatt, who was a trustee at our school. He was talking before the Rotary Club on education and [laugh] I'm sure the Rotary we:e very pleased with what he said, but it was all wrong. I think Joe knows it was wrong too. EC: He was probably being instructed by Merrill Cook. WP: I was really disappointed. I wish he hadn't done it.
76

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 So many well meaning people get so fouled up when it comes to evaluating education and trying to determine what's the best road to go. Most people don't know and those who do know are not in positions of power. That's the sorry thing about education in America, the people who are in power are the people who don't know. Boards of educations for instance, Everett, I think are real enemies of education.
EC: So many times, they represent the property interests and that's about it.
WP: Or their own interests. EC: Yes. WP: I know several people who have run for boards of
education who are just so damn mad at the superintendent or something, or a ~eacher, or they didn't get the contract to grease the buses or some damn thing, and it's bad. I think that is very bad. I think that local control in a lot of ways is a very bad thing for education. EC: What is the control of Rowland Hall-St. Mark's? WP: They have a board of trustees. EC: Appointed by whom? WP: They're appointed by the board that is self perpetuating. I think we had twenty people on the board. They could serve for three, three-year terms,
77

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 then they had to leave. Then they could come back, but I think there were two-year terms and three-year terms.
EC: Did the board members have to have students in the school?
WP: No. EC: Just concerned interested citizens who wanted-WP: As a matter of fact, the board would go to great
lengths to try to identify people in the community who would be good board members. EC: I see. WP: And of course when I was there, when the school was very poor, it was not an attractive job. People thought if you got on the board you're an easy touch. As a matter of fact, at least the way I think, if you agree to serve on a board, then you're obligated. Some people don't feel that same way. [laugh] I guess that I did a good job in educating board members to my way of thinking. I got a lot of them to leave--the ones who were doing nothing--by simply telling them by vi~tue of your membership as a trustee of this school you're obligated to support it financially and in other ways too. They finally got the message. Today they have a very strong board and they are the principal supporters and financial supporters. That
78

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 is wonderful.
EC: They're not drawn from the membership of the Episcopal church--just community supporters?
WP: That's correct. Now the Episcopal church does reserve the right to appoint three board members. It's one every three years. I can't even remember, and it wasn't a big issue. The members of the board who came from that direction; I don't even remember them in that context. So, it's really not run by the Episcopal church at all.
EC: What is your justification for private schools? Do you think they are essential to bring a balance in education in the state?
WP: Yes, I am a very strong supporter of some private schools. Good private schools are good for education. Your store-front schools I have little sympathy for. Well, I think my giving you a story about something that happened would illustrate my concern for private education and answe~ your question. You remember when John Singer was shot?
EC: Yes. WP: Yes, and the aftermath of that, especially as it
affected schools. You might remember that the superintendent of Salt Lake Schools told his board that this was a real problem and that they had better
79

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 influence the legislature some way so that the children in this state could be protected by the public. In other words, the authority should be given to the public school districts to supervise private schools at least to the point that they know that these children are not being abused by not getting a good education--that sort of thing. Do you remember that?
EC: I remember that. Yes. WP: Well, there were several private schools in Salt Lake
City and they were all writing letters to the editor saying to the superintendent, "You'd better not come in our school. You're not welcome and you' 11 get thrown out , " and a11 t h i s so r t o f t h in g . I wr o t e to him and told him that I knew exactly what he was talking about and he was absolutely right. Children do need to be protected from these screwballs. We've always had them in our society. I supported him a hundred percent. I was the only person in private education in Utah who supported him and he was grateful. As a matter of fact, he used my letter in defending his position. Well, I wasn't very popular with private schools, but we didn't have anything in common with other private schools in this valley. Rowland Hall-St. Mark's is not the same kind of
80

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3
school. EC: Some of these so called private schools are definite
parochial schools and trying to present a parochial educational point of view. WP: In some cases that can be bad. Children ought to have advocates from somewhere. They have no way of defending themselves against stupid parents or religious leaders or whatever. I just think that's our responsibility. EC: In this regard then, you had approved of some kind of state examination of the curriculum of a school and so on to see that it met certain standards? WP: I'd have no argument with that. I'm not sure that you'd have to go that far. There are probably other ways to do it that would ease people's minds a little about meddling. I think in a high school at least you have to be certified or you have to be-EC: Accredited? WP: Accredited. That takes care of most of it. That accreditation thing is a very, very thorough examination. At least, in Utah, the people responsible for that do a good job. Joyce Hanson is a gem, I think. I don't know whether we deserve her or not. She's a wonderful woman and very dedicated to r-_~ r role. She's tireless and makes everybody better
81

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 than they are. She makes people work very hard. I am a good ex amp1 e of that be c au s e she used to c a 11 me all the time. I never could turn her down, no matter what I was doing. If she wanted me, I was there. That wouldn't have happened if it had been somebody else.
EC: Let's identify Joyce Hanson for the tape. WP: Joyce Hanson is a--well, what is her official title?
She's the director of the accrediting association of the State of Utah for the State Board of Education. - I'm not quite sure what her official title is, but she's an accreditation specialist. She directs all of this. Every high school in the state of Utah has to file a report every year and they have to be accredited by going through a self-evaluation every ten years. She makes sure that these things are all done. When her organization meets once a year, they meet in either Seattle or Portland or Reno--those three places mainly. I don't know why they never meet in Salt Lake. I think it's because the people in Salt Lake don't like to stay in Salt Lake. [laughter] It's more fun to go someplace else. But anyhow, they go and all of these Northwestern states bring their reports from all of their schools. All of those reports are read by committees from other states. Then they either agree or disagree and work it out so
82

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3
that the schools know where they stand after that. Well, I went every year, and I became very familiar with the schools throughout the Northwest. I was kind of surprised, I didn't think Utah schools were that good. But I can tell you by reading the reports, I would say that Utah has the best schools in the Northwest. EC: This is public school as well as private? WP: That's right. EC: That's interesting. WP: Yes. I think that Utah does a pretty good job, really. EC: As a result of this study headed by David Gardner, there were certain reforms made in the curriculum here in the state among the language requirements for high schools. What about in the private schools? Have yo u a 1 wa y s had t hi s kind of r e qu i r em en t? What they are requiring for public high schools reflect what your curriculum was there at Rowland Hall-St. Mark's? WP: Well, he was doing what we've always done. We've always had a language requirement of two years in the modern language and two years of Latin or three years of the modern language. That's been forever, you know. During the '60s and '70s there was pressure to change the requirements. I did have a board member
83

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 who said, "Teaching Latin is out of date." [chuckle] She didn't see any justification for Latin. It was a dead language and no practical purpose. So the education committee decided that it would be dropped from the curriculum. When fall came and I published the curriculum, Latin was there and this board member came storming into my office saying, "I thought we agreed that we were going to drop Latin." And I said, "I didn't agree and I run the school." I got away with it. So I don't know whether they still teach Latin or not, but as long as I was there, they did.
EC: Other than languages, were there reforms in the sciences?
WP: Well, in small school, you can't have an expanded curriculum. You have certain things that you teach and everyone takes practically the same thing. There are a few things that you might choose, but not too many. So we started out offering biology in ninth grade and then physics in the tenth and then chemistry. Then if you wanted to, you could take an AP course in bio-chemistry or something like that. And mathematics, the same. There were four full years of every discipline of the basics.
EC: One thing that we've neglected to get, is when you became head master what were the circumstances? 84

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 WP: I was afraid you'd ask. [laughter] They're not very
happy circumstances, and I thought that it might--it might destroy me. When the lady who became the head of both schools retired, there was appointed a man from Texas to be headmaster. It didn't work out. He was a very gentle person, but the school just didn't function under his leadership. One thing, we've always had a boarding department and we had kids from all over the world in that boarding school. Sometimes we had as few as seventeen or eighteen and sometimes as many as thirty five or forty. The boarding school was really suffering at this time. You know the period. It was a difficult period in 1967. This gentleman felt that the school would be much stronger if we could do away with that boarding department. There would be far fewer headaches for him and so he systematically went about closing it. During the summer of 1969 he went on a vacation and asked me if I would run the school in his absence. I told him I would under the condition that he would give me his itinerary, that he would call me at least every other day while he was gone, that he would let me know were he was so I could get in touch with him because there were decisions that had to be made that I couldn't make and that I felt I couldn't make. So he left and
85

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3
he was gone six weeks. I never heard from him. I spent hundreds of dollars in telephone calls and I never could find him. Well, life goes on and I was intrusted with the school, so I had to make some decisions whether I wanted to or not. One of the things that happened during that summer was his secretary came to me and said, "I'm not sure what to do." She said, "I have twelve requests from boarding students in today' s mail." He was saying that there were no requests for boarding students and that we should close it. The board had decided we'd better close it, so it was closed. Then I had to go about finding schools for the kids who were already in the school. There were about ten who were still coming back. I couldn't b톏lieve it. I said to her, "Is this just a one day thing?" I said, "Have you received requests from other students?" And she said, "Oh yes. We ' v e h ad about s e v en t y . " And I sa i d , " What? " And so after sitting, thinking about this for a while, I finally asked her to bring me all of these letters. She said, "I don't have them." "What do you mean, you don't have them?" And she said, "Well, they've been destroyed." I said, "The letters were answer-ed. Will you please bring me copies of the letters." She said, "I don't have those either." Well, that was very
86

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 upsetting. Then the contractors were arriving on the c amp us , pre par in g to b u i 1 d a b u i 1 d in g . I d i d n ' t know what they were doing, but I knew that they had machinery out there. So I went out and asked the architect who had the plans. It was a big quonset hut. It was going to be over the play ground. It was a covered playground. It didn't have water in it, it didn't have toilet facilities or anything. It just had two of those big wall-heaters on either side and that was it. The board had okayed the construction of this building. Well, I called the vice-chairman of the board and asked him to come up, and so he did. I presented him with these problems. He was horrified and so he stopped everything. He told me, he says, "You get as many of these kids in the boarding department that you can." He says, "They' 11 build this building over my dead body." So I felt terrible because I knew that I was causing a lot of problems. When the headmaster returned, he was brought on the carpet and fired. Here's the school almost ready to begin the year, you know. So this man from the board came to me and he said, "Well, you're it. You've got to run the school." I said, "That's 1 ike condemning somebody to the gas chamber." I said, "Don't you realize what you're doing to me." And I said, "What 87

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 will the professional community think of this? You can't ask me to do that." He was a very eloquent guy. He's quoting all kinds of people, you know, about good men don't sit idly by when they're needed and all this stuff. The faculty came and said, "Do it. You've got to do it." So I took over the school under those circumstances. It was terrible. I don't know how I ever managed to pull it off, but I was st i 11 there twelve years later.
EC: Now , had the s c h o o 1 grown consider a b 1 y in this period?
WP: No. EC: It hadn't. WP: No. EC: What about your funding? Was it adequate or what? WP: No, it was not. As a matter of fact, we were about a
half a million dollars in debt. EC: This was one of your major responsibilities when you
came in? WP: That's right. ED: How did you go about resolving the problem? WP: Probably what I' 11 be remembered for most is making
the school financially solvent. They had practices that were just inconsistent with good management. For one thing, people could register their students
88

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 without paying tuition and they payed it whenever they felt like it. Sometimes if the kid didn't make it or if it didn't work out, then they wouldn't pay it at all. A student would have to leave and they'd forgive the tuition and that sort of thing. So the first thing I did was present to the board this new policy: "If you register a child here, you are obligated to pay tuition. I don't care whether a student stays only one day or a week or a month or whatever, but they have to pay the full year's tuition." If they can't pay the full tuition--we did have an a r r an gem en t with an ins ur an c e c om p any , and they had to go through that in sur anc e company. The insurance company pays the tuition and they pay the insurance company. That's all there is to it. Well, that was a real "donny-brook" for about six months when people were getting used to it. As soon as they were used to it, it was fine. So we started collecting all the monies that were due us on tuitions and that helped a lot. Well, the next thing, was the tuition was way too low.
EC: What percentage of the tuition or of the cost to the school came from tuition?
WP: Well, it was supposed to be 100 percent. [laugh] Where else is it going to come from? Well, you might
89

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 have fund raising drives, but I never believed in raising funds for operation. I don't think that you can really influence people to give money if you're just going to use it for operational purposes. If you're going to raise funds, it ought to be for something special.
EC: Like a building or special programs.
WP: Right. Scholarships or something that they can be proud of. You can say this is what your money did. They don't like the idea of, "Well, it bought chalk and it paid the teacher's salary" or something along that 1 ine. Well, we had an inferiority complex, as most private schools in the West did at one time. Most of them don't any more. Our tuitions were about half of what they should be. So I told the board, "You know these people are not paying for a service. You're giving it to them and they're not paying for it. They're paying for half of it. Now, where's the other half going to come from?" I said, "If you want to pay it, that's fine. If you don't want to pay it, then they've got to pay it." They thought about it and Oh, there was a lot of wringing of hands. I remember one gentleman saying, "Well, you' !"e closing the school is what you're doing." He said, "They' 11 never accept it. If you boost tuition that much, the 90

WILLIAM M. PURDY #3 school is dead." I said, "No, it isn't. As a matter of fact, parents will not only will understand, but they will appreciate the school more than they do now." I was absolutely right. We didn't loose one student.
EC: What percentage of your student body is in-state and what outside? Now you spoke about your boarding students mostly foreign.
WP: Well, out of roughly three hundred students we had from twenty to forty people who didn't live in Salt Lake City. It was not very big, but they did have a great influence, a good influence on the school. It was giving us a different point of view, so to speak.
EC: Less parochial, more cosmopolitan? WP: That's right. That's one thing we were really looking
for. [END OF TAPE]

THI S IS TAPE 112 0F 0 UR SEC 0 ND INTERVIEW WITH WILL I AM M. PURDY. WE'RE RECORDING ON OCTOBER 12, 1988. PART OF THE COOLEY ORAL HISTORY PROGRAM AND MR. PURDY IS TELLING US ABOUT HIS ROLE AT ROWLAND HALL ST. MARK'S SCHOOL AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HE ENCOUNTERED AND HIS SOLUTIONS. [TAPE /14]
EC: We were talking about funding in particular. WP: Yes, of course these people who came in from foreign
countries brought in tuition money , which was very desirable. Another thing, and sweet are the uses of adversity, you remember during the '70s when the interest rates began to rise? Well, I really took advantage of that. Matter of fact it saved our lives. I made a $100,000 in interest in one year. Can you believe that? In a small school like that? You know, that's equivalent to seventy students. And it made it possible for us to do what we had to do. Finally, I could see that for this school, if it were ever going to break out of a mold that had lasted for a hundred years of just barely operating year to year, something had to be done. We belong to the National Association of Independent Schools, and most of the independent schools of Ame!"ica are in the eastern part of the United States, although there are several in the West. But most of them are in the East, the old ones. Well, I had an opportunity to visit a lot of these schools. Matter of fact, I went to a seminar
92

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 sponsored by the Independent School Association in New Hampshire and spent a summer in a school for headmasters operated by two professors from Harvard, who were really good at what they were doing. There were forty-five of us there. We went through all kinds of scenarios. What fascinated me was that these schools, all of them were successful or most of them successful. As a matter of fact one school where we were housed, at E:feter, in New Hampshire, had an endowment so large that they could operate without any students for a hundred years. And I thought, Oh Lord ! We had no endowment at a11 . But a11 o f t h e s e schools had endowments, which really got me thinking. So I came back and just before the close of my career there, I went to the board and I told them, "A school 1 ike this has to have an endowment , i f not on1 y for the funds that it provides, but anyone who understands good private education would expect you to have an endowment. If you don't you're going to be suspect." And so I convinced them. Although there were some board members who really didn't like the idea, we went about and we raised like, I can't even remember, I think it was $400, 000 for an endowment, which they have now. And it's growing. And success brings success. And in the seven or eight years since
93

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 I left that place they've had fantastic success.
EC: Ar e t he s e p eo p 1 e who g i v e to t he endowment pr e tty much alumni or just people who want to see a private school succeed?
WP: Well, most of them are friends of the school, and long term friends. You mentioned the Pat Gibbons, Jim Hogle, the Joe Rosenblatts, these people are long time friends of the school. They've been there forever. Mrs. Gibbons is an alumni of Rowland Hall and Mrs. Hogle is also. Joe Rosenblatt's daughter went there. They all have that kind of a connection with the school. But then there are other people. Salt Lake is becoming more cosmopolitan, as you know. Businesses come in here and they bring people in. These people come from areas where there is a strong sentiment for private schools and they don't see very much of that here and they latch onto Rowland HallSt. Mark's. They have been able to attract some very good people to their board of trustees and they give money.
EC: As I recall, Dave Bigler was made a board member, was he not? Did he also bring U.S. Steel money with that?
WP: I don't remember. We put the bite on U.S. Steel but I don't think we got anything. But Dave was a gem. Dave was very helpful. I like board members who either can 94

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 give a lot of money or give a lot of talent. And he had the talent. He knew how things worked in this country, and he helped me a great deal. I'm very fond of Dave. And so we raised money because of him, simply because he knew how to do things.
EC: Now, you mentioned a student body of about three hundred. Was this sort of an arbitrary figure that you've set? "Here's our maximum?" Or is this just that you could attract that number of students?
WP: Well, you know, we really beat the bushes for students and that's about how many we could find. I know I went out recruiting students especially for the boarding school from Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. We had quite a few students from those states. We had a difficult time attracting students from Salt Lake. We did not have very many Mormon students. And I don't know why because I certainly didn't discourage them and I don't think anybody else did. But there was feeling that Mormons were suspicious of an Episcopal school. Gradually we got a few, and in the lower schools especially, quite a few Mormon kids.
EC: Particularly during the '60s, anything that smacked of elitism was looked upon with some disfavor. Did that carry aver into attitudes towards your school?
95

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 Because I'm a native of Utah and for some reason I learned Rowland Hall-St. Mark's was only for the rich kids, that it's only for the upper social strata. Was there some of that stigma?
WP: Oh yes, regrettably there was a lot of it. And there were a lot of people who combatted that at the school also. I certainly did. What I wanted to do more than anything was to establish some funds for student tuition. The Vietnam thing, again, adversity made us stronger. A man carne to me who had adopted a Vietnamese family of five children. He was supporting them, gave them a job and a place to live. He came to me and said, "These kids are dying in this public s c ho o1 down her e . Can yo u t a k e t h em? " An d I s a i d , "Lord." He responded, "I don't have the resources to send them to your school. I'm already putting out so many thousands of dollars, I can't do it but could you raise some money for tuition for those kids?" I liked the man, he was a good supporter of the school and I said, "Okay, we' 11 take them." I funded everyone of those kids. It was fairly easy. We were all feeling a little guilty about Vietnam and people had a soft spot for Vietnamese. The least we can do is give their kids something. So we had a lot of Vietnamese. 96

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 EC: So this is part of a scholarship program that you
began? WP: And this became part of that scholarship program and
it was a good one. We raised a lot of money and things started getting better. Elitism, I don't want to drop that subject because I don't want you to think that I am opposed to elitism. Elitism to me means something different than it means to most people. I would like to see schools where all students felt they were elite and they were treated that way. I don't think there's anything wrong with promoting good people. You can do it in a positive way. If a student is outstanding, don't put that student down because of that. He deserves praise, and he deserves anything he gets, especially if he'll use the knowledge he has to help humanity in general. I don't know what elitism means. I know what it means to a lot of people, I hear them talking and I don't like the way they use it. Those opposed to elitism sound to me like they're saying, "We want everybody to be exactly the same." That's crazy because people are not the same, people are not equal. They may be born equal but that's the end of it. People are not equal, that's why I support private schools. In this class of mine we had fourteen students who were all
97

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4
tremendous students and they did very well. They all became very successful people. I think they did that because they went to school there. EC: Let me add something. Because you had fourteen who excelled, did you have a very difficult or tough entrance system that permitted you to select these? Or did you take those who might apply? WP: No, we did not take people just because they applied. We would accept them if they were bright. They could be failing, but if they were bright we would take them. EC: So in this private schools are quite different from public schools where they have to take everyone? WP: It's interesting that some of the people that we took were ejected from the public schools. I have one person in mind. This boy's father came to me and said, "This kid's just been kicked out of the seventh grade. Can you take him?" I said, "Well, I' 11 look at him." So we tested him, he had an IQ of a hundred and forty. Very high achievement. EC: That's why he was kicked out. WP: He was so bored and he wouldn't accept what the teachers were telling him. He would argue with them and they didn't like that. He told me that this one teacher said obedience is the highest quality that a
98

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 man should possess. I think this is what got him kicked out because he said, "Well, maybe I ought to enroll my dog here." Well, we took him. He was a Merit Scholar. He went to Connecticut Weslean for his undergraduate work. Went to Yale for a masters and then through Harvard business school. That is a typical story of kids who came to that school. They would have died on the vine if it hadn't been for that school, but I never thought this school was in competition with the public - schools. I always told my friends in the public schools, "I can help you and you can help me. We can improve schools in general if we work together. You can borrow anything that we do. We experiment all the time and if we come up with something successful, you can have it, I don't care. All you have to do is come up and look." They very seldom did that but the invitation was there. Of course I used them. I had a lot of friends in public education and a lot of really bright people. They helped me a lot.
EC: With the present controversy right now over the shortage of public funds and also the difficulty of private schools to raise money, what do you think of this Initiative C which is presently before the electorate? [A tax credit for students attending
99

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 private schools.]
WP: I don't approve of that at all and I never have. When it first came up ten or fifteen years ago a lot of peo p1 e j urn pe d on the b and wag on and sa i d , " Boy , t h i s is the answer to both private school problems and pub 1 i c s c h o o 1 pro b1 ems . " I don ' t agree . I think it would destroy public schools.
EC: But would it aid private schools? WP: I doubt it, I really don't know. I haven't thought
about that angle. It would help with some of it. EC: The Catholic schools the other day came out in favor
of initiative C. WP: I think it would favor the store front schools, these
people who have great promoters. The public doesn't have enough information to know what's good and what isn't good. You have supporters for Merrill Cook and I think he's way off base and I don't even think he knows what he's talking about, but still people will 1 isten to him and say, "Oh, that's the way it should be." Well, that isn't the way it should be. What we should do in this country is get back behind our public schools and make them into super schools, good schools. We can do it. Some of this is the responsibility of the educators and some of it is the responsibility of the tax payers. I don't know
100

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 whether you' 11 ever be able to get them together. I doubt it.
EC: We began this discussion and you brought up the John
Singer case. Don't you see this Initiative c as
fostering the kind of thing that he was attempting? WP: Absolutely, absolutely. It would make so many
pro b1 ems that yo u ' d end u p d e s t r o y i n g e v e r yt h i ng . You'd destroy the schools, all of the schools. I really think it is very, very destructive. Why people can't understand that, I don't know. I guess the thing in this country that bothers me more than anything else is ignorance. I know people in this country have good insights but they don't have the kind of intelligence that is needed to really straighten this country out. They are influenced by people who are really out to hurt them, not to help them. These people are articulate and all they're out for is their own interests. They either want to make money themselves or they want to become influential. They do terrible damage and they do it because people cannot evaluate what they are doing intelligently. That is very disturbing to me. EC: I think we're seeing it right now in our political campaign, one of the most sickening-Wp : 0 h , t h i s po 1 i t i c a 1 c amp a i gn is an em barr ass men t . I

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 want to vomit whenever I hear George Bush. I like George Bush, but he doesn't believe one word of what he's saying. I really don't think he does. I would be very disappointed if he did.
EC: I would hope he is more intelligent than that. WP: He is saying what the people want to hear. And I
think that is really sad in this country that people have reached that point. We've got to educate our people and we've got to find a way. If we don't, why we're going to decline and that's too bad. EC: Do you think part of the answer is through private schools? Can you be a little more bold in pressing these things than you can in public schools? WP: Yes, that's exactly why I am such a strong supporter of good private schools and there aren't many of them in the West. These schools can influence. Now what they've got to do is they've got to get out of their shells and take more responsibility for general ed uc at ion . Wh at t h e y ' v e d o n e , a nd t h e y ' v e d o n e i t very well, is to educate their own charges. They have been content to do that and their influence has not spread. Well, they have countless success stories that they could sell to the American people and say look what we have done. Now we don't want to take over. We want to help and we can do it. If people can
102

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 see the success; it seems to me that they would be influenced by it. More and more private ~chool people are seeing that they have that kind of responsibility.
EC: I've just been thinking, how many of your graduates have gone on to college training in teaching and then gone into the public schools? Are you aware of any? Or do they go on to get their Ph.Ds and they go into science, business and into college positions and so on?
WP: Unfortunately-EC: But I was just thinking just what you said, we've got
to educate the public. Well, what a good way to do it if you have the products of your private schools now going back to work with the public schools. WP: Understand, Everett, this wisdom I have I didn't have when I was a headmaster. I was very protective of my charges and I didn't have time to think too much about other people' s--just so long as I was successful. I didn't really mature to the point that I have now, where I can see the really great contribution that private education can make in the public sector by sharing and by showing. Just for example, the good private schools, the Exceters, the St. Paul's and so forth. It's harder to get in to
103

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4
these schools than it is to get into Harvard. They are very difficult to get into. I have to recapture my train of thought here. The point I was going to make is the teachers in these schools are often not certified teachers. EC: That's interesting. WP: They have no education classes and still they are teaching in the best schools in the United States. We ought to think about that. We have been brainwashed into thinking that if you don't have a degree in education, if you haven't taken these education courses you can't teach. And that is nonsense, it just isn't true. Maybe we ought to say, as several people have suggested in these last couple of years, that they should do away with schools of education and put that responsibility elsewhere in the various disciplines. Let the science department train their teachers and let the history department train their teachers, and so on. I think they'd do far, far better. In my own experience the only education class that I can remember as having any value at all was a class I had from Rosa Bird Mariman, who was a Shakespearean scholar at Westminster. She was the one person down there who could have taught anywhere. She was a master at her subject. They had her teaching
104

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 one course in education. It was the preparation in subject matter. She taught English and I got my education on how to teach English from her. It was marvelous. She didn't think anything about education, she just taught me about English. I don't know whether I should put this in print or not--I don't care, I don't care whether anybody who reads it doesn't like it or not, but you may want to edit it. We've had people who have been head of the Departments of Education, who in my opinion were bad for education. They stayed there for year after year after year. Well, that's criminal I think. When universities can't manage their own affairs, things are getting pretty bad. We ought to do away with schools of education, period.
EC: It's rather interesting, Bill, here on campus in the history department and now it's university wide, they have sponsored classes to teach professors and particularly TAs how to teach, but apart from the College of Education. That is, within your own discipline, this thing's going on now that I think was unheard of a while ago.
WP: Yes, of course I'm speaking from quite a distance. I don't know what's going on right now. It very well could be that people are doing things that they
105

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 should've been doing a long time ago and that's encouraging.
EC: Well, I'm glad to get your reaction to this current pr oblem of Initiative C, Bill. It seems like one of your major problems has always been funding. How is it possible for you to plan expansion and take over a whole abandoned Salt Lake City school for the home of Rowland Hall-St. Mark's?
WP: When I took over the school in 1969 we had an indebtedness of about half a million dollars. When I left it in 1981 we had a half a million dollars in the bank. With that the new head master really was in a very good position. Everything was just right for him. I like him very much. Although I was not on the committee to choose a new head master I had as much to do with choosing him as anybody. I think he's there because I wanted him to be there. He has done a good job. He is a intelligent man. He had a surplus and we had this new building that very quickly came along as an answer to a prayer, I might say. At first they rented that building. It is attractive and well made. We had the success of the endowment behind us and people were looking up and saying, "This school knows where it's going now." This young man, he's had a lot of success in the East and he speaks the 106

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4
language of a lot of people who have moved into Salt Lake. He understands them, they understand him, and he has been able to raise a lot of money. Well, that building cost a million dollars, which is a giveaway. What they've done to that building? I don't know whether you've been in it. EC: I have not. WP: It is a beautiful building. He initiated a program that we thought about for a long time-the ski program. This Rowmark, where he had Olympic skiers coming out of Rowland Hall and the gymnast that participated in Seoul. She goes to school at Rowland Hall. They have designed that program for these olympic skiers and gymnasts and they'll probably expand on that. I was thinking of going into ballet or something for special students who want to make careers out of things like that. But we have the best ski team of any school in the world. EC: I wasn't aware of that. WP: No? Matter of fact, I called the head master-they' r e a 1 ways on the news : " Ro wm ark skier s do this ... " I said, "For God sakes, tell those people to explain that Rowmark is Rowland Hall-St. Mark's. EC: See, it never occurred to me. WP: They are doing that more lately. I t ' s very
107

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 successful. [END OF SIDE 111]
EC: This is side two of ~ape two and our second interview with Wi 11 i am M. Purdy. We ' r e t a 1 king about the funding of Rowland Hall-St. Mark's and the movement to the new facility in Salt Lake City.
WP: The tuition is now up to about where it should be. It's about four thousand dollars a year for a day student and it's more than three thousand for a elementa~y student. You multiply that by seven hundred and you're taking in a lot of money from tuitions. I think that their budget this year is over a million dollars.
EC: The operating costs of the school are still carried on from tuition and then it's your foundation program, your grant program and so on that supports the purchase of the new building?
WP: That's right. I never stopped making that point that you raise money not for operational expenses but for things that will make the school better. I think I d i d a pretty good j o b o f e d uc at in g b o a r d mem b e r s  I feel very good about my contribution to that school. But it did more for me than I did for it, I'll admit that.
EC: Why did you leave?
108

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 WP: Well, I was getting old and the medical problem that
is bothering me now, started then. I have lapses of memory and things like that. I found it embarrassing that I would often forget things. I said, "Well, the time has come now when you have tQ step to the side." That was a very wise decision because the new headmaster was able to do what I was not able to do. He had the talents in those areas that I didn't. Mine was more pick and shovel type stuff and his was computers. He's much more refined. EC: Geared to the needs of the day? WP: Right. So I felt very good about the whole thing. EC: Did they have an adequate retirement program for you, Bill, that you could afford to retire? WP: No, but my wife still works and that helps. We did get a good retirement program going in 1970. EC: Are you covered by TIAA down there? WP: Yes, it is excellent, except I was only in it for ten years. Had I been in it for twenty I'd have had a good retirement. The board was very sympathetic. I geared the thing for me. I said, "Okay, the board will match five percent of your salary and put it in the TIAA or CREF. If you're over fifty-five it's 10 percent. I was fifty-five at the time, so I got matching 10 percent. That's pretty good. So it makes
109

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 a difference and I'm able to hold my head up.
EC: Were you able to make the salaries down there competitive? You indicated some of the problems you encountered when you went there.
WP: Unfortunately not, although we tried. What was really hard in the first place was salaries when the schools combined. The schools were combined when I took over. The first thing I discovered was that the ladies who had been working at Rowland Hall were making half of what the men were making at St. Mark's.
EC: Duplicating experiences up here at the university. They'd gone through the same thing here, Bill.
WP: Well, here was a young man I'd just hired in his first year teaching. He was going to make more than this lady who had master's degree from the University of North Carolina, who had thirty years experience. So I went to the board and I said, "In all good conscience I just can't do this and we've got to change this." They said, "Well, It's going to cost a lot of money." I said, "Yes, it's going to cost a lot of money but it has to be done." Unfortunately it prevented me from raising salaries for a few years while I got them equalized. After they were equalized I tried very hard to get salaries respectable. They're getting there but it's still not quite.
110

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 EC: I've known people who have been in the public system
who chose to go to Rowland Hall. Is it the attraction of working with these better students and under more ideal conditions; where you're dealing with fifteen kids rather than forty-five or whatever? WP: No quest ion about it. I would have worked there for nothing if I could have found a way to 1 i ve. The happiest days of my life were teaching, not as head master, but as a teacher at St. Mark's. EC: When you read the 1 etters to the ed ito r and some o f these tax initiative people, that this message should be brought out. When they speak of the low morale of the public school teacher--my wife is an ex-public school teacher, my two daughters are too. I know what they had to contend with. Yet you don't hear this side of the joys of teaching as a result of smaller classes and so on, a more satisfying experience. WP: People in the public schools experience the same thing when they have an opportunity. My wife for instance, just by some odd quirk, had a class of nineteen about four years ago. She was in heaven. She enjoyed that year tremendously. Everything went so well. She was happy. The children were happy. Well these people who say class size doesn't matter are nuts. Let's just put it that way. It does matter. At
111

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 St. Mark's it was a joy to go to work. I really had fun teaching. Those kids were so enthusiastic. When you have only a few people to motivate it's not hard to do. Although they were rascals. When I first went up there they were, they were just like kids, they'd do a lot of crazy things. A lot of times they wouldn't do their homework and this sort of thing. It was in 1956, my first year. and I was teaching the ninth grade. I was having problems. Oh, they were wild, wild but good students. And I said, "Okay." This was in October. I think I had twelve students in that class at that time. I said, "Out of you twelve students the six with the highest averages on April 15, I'm going to take on a river trip. I'll tell you, I nave never seen any class work so hard in my life. I had to take all but two because they were within one percentage point of each other, just a fraction of one percent. They worked and boy I' 11 tell you, I just couldn't believe it, parents couldn't believe it no one could believe that these kids were doing
'
the things that they were doing. I mean, they were doing things that I didn't do in college. It was fun, it was really fun. EC: You had some satisfying experiences. You already said how you enjoyed teaching. What would you consider
112

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 your greatest achievement there at the school?
WP: At that school? I guess establishing the financial integrity of the school was my greatest achievement because it was very difficult to do. I had to hurt a lot of people, I mean, not hurt them but I'd liked to have helped them more, but I couldn't. We had to save the money, we had to do a lot of things in order to get to a place where we could really fly. We did that and they understood. The teachers understood. You do what  you have to do but those teachers knew that I really liked them, that I respected them, and that I appreciated them. They worked their tails off. This is a point that should be brought out: I view administration a little differently than most people do. I was the administrator, but I always considered myself a servant of that school rather than the boss. I was the teacher's servant. If they needed something, they wanted something, they wanted to talk about something; they came to me and I listened and I did anything I could to help them. And I figured that was my mission as an administrator. And I think that administrators ought to look at that theory of administering. It might have something for everybody that would want to embrace it. I was able to do that because people backed me up. They understood me
113

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 because if I didn't know something I'd admit it, instead of trying to hide it. People understood and
helped. I don't know whether it was luck or what ' but
it was good. EC: Outside of your experience at Rowland Hall-St.
Mark's, what would you consider your greatest achievement? WP: Well, I have a theory about the purpose of education and it doesn't jive with too many people. I listen to people in this state and this country talking about the purpose of education and what it's supposed to do, and I can't understand where they're coming from. Especially people who run for office of the board of e d uc at ion . I he a r them saying , " Wh a t we n e e d i s mor e practical education. Teach these kids how to use screwdrivers or how to fix automobiles and stuff. To hell with this book learning stuff." And I want to weep when I hear those kind of things. These people win the elections too. My theory has to do with the r e a so n for being on t hi s p1 an e t  There has to be a reason for it and I think it's to learn how to be a human being and what it means to be a human being. The only way you can do that is by appreciating the past. You have to take people who have been outstanding, for some reason, all the way back. I
114

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 t e 11 my stud en t s , "Why do you think three of the world's famous playwrights all came from the same century in this little country of Greece? How do you account for that?" At least it gets them thinking. You've got to understand, you've got to know who these people are and you've got to find out what they did. Because what they did may have something very important in it for you. And once we get the feeling that this world has produced truly spectacular people, and we need to know why some human beings are so beautiful. I think we had better find out. Find these beautiful people and find out what made them that way. That is what I try to do. I take people out into the wilderness and I show them things that they have never seen  before and I let them discover things. I see their minds opening up and I see them becoming better and better human beings. I'm pretty good at that. And that I'd like to think, is my greatest achievement.
EC: On the way you've undoubtedly suffered some disappointments, you haven't achieved all you wanted to do in some particular areas. What were some of those?
WP: Well, there are so many areas. I failed miserably, maybe not miserably, as a father. I could do things 115

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 for other people's children that I couldn't do for my own. That hurt me deeply. I've tried to not get too down as a result but I know it really had a very devastating effect. I think I'm pretty lucky to have got ten through at all. It would have been easy just to run away. I thought about doing that sometimes. My c h i 1 d r en had pr o b l em s . Th e y ' r e a11 grown now , and things are getting better.
EC: Are there professional things that you had hoped to achieve and didn't?
WP: Yes, I wanted to do a lot more writing than I've done. The reason that I didn't, I suppose, I can rationalize the problems I had with my family and so forth.
EC: Well, as an administrator I know one reason you didn't. You simply exhausted yourself in dealing with problems in administration.
WP: Right. You know, I've had failures. There is no question that I've tried things and failed at them but I've never looked at failures too seriously. Somebody said they're opportunities and that's the way you should look at them. I tried to do that. I've always thought adversity offered great opportunities b e c a u s e I ' ve s e en it ha ppen in my own 1 i f e . You ' ve got to be smart enough to see where the opportunities 116

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 are. They are there because of some adverse thing. It's really funny. I am always quoting Shakespeare's the "sweet are the uses of adversity" because I believe that guy really knew what he was talking about. I told my students the same thing. I don't baby people and my students really got a kick out of me. We've had deaf students for instance, and we didn't treat them any different than any other student. We didn't give them any fancy equipment. If they wanted to learn they found a way. This one boy came in and was really complaining because he was handicapped. I looked at him, [he could read lips] and I said, "Everybody is handicapped." I said, " I'd rather have your handicap than some people I know. You've got brains. Don't talk to me about handicaps. Now just get out of here and do what you're supposed to do." Every time I see him he laughs about that. People told me, "You're going to have to put these ramps and elevators in this school." And I told them, "Baloney. I'll carr-y them up the stairs myself. Don't give me that bull about putting thousands of dollars into an elevator for two people." I just don't buy that kind of stuff. I'm a little outdated and I am a rebel and I certainly don't fit the mainstream in a lot of ways but I like people and especially kids. I
117

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 love kids. The older I get the harder it is because I love them too much and I see people abusing them and that really hurts me. So I don't know.
EC: Well, as someone who's known you for some time, almost thirty years I guess, I look upon your life as one of great success. I can't see many failures.
WP: Well, I agree with you. I have been very, very fortunate. My life has been so good, so interesting. I've met so many good people. You know, your memories are the things that are valuable. The future is very uncertain. But the past--that's where everything is.
EC: That's with you. WP: And that's the only thing you have. Really, that's
the only thing that you have. So why not revel in it. Remember when you and Dr. Mortenson came out to Manila? EC: Yeah. WP: I remember that just as plain as day. You were director of the historical foundation, I enjoyed it so much then mainly because I enjoyed you. I've always admired you very much. EC: Oh thank you. That's the way I look upon you. We have a mutual admiration society here. Well Bill, I want to thank you for giving your time. We' 11 get this down and you'll have a chance to review and then
11 8

WILLIAM M. PURDY #4 we'll deposit it in the archives and you' 11 have copies for yourself. So thanks for giving of yourself.
WP: Well, it's my pleasure and I'm very flattered that you would ask me.
EC: Thank you. [END OF INTERVIEW]
