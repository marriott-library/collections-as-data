 THE FOLLOWING I S AN INTERVIEW WITH GERMAINE STEELE CONDUCTED BY CLARE ENGLE AT GRAND JUNCTION, COLORADO, ON AUGUST 1, 1970 [FOR THE UTAH URANIUM ORAL HISTORY PROJECT. TAPE #1].
CE: Thank you very much, Gerry, for taking time with me tonight. As you know I'm working on a project that involves the uranium industry on the Colorado Plateau. I find the area in which you were involved in this industry rather interesting. I think this would be a unique experience especially for me since I know very little about the school system, for instance, in Uravan. Before we begin talking about Uravan will you tell me where you were born and where you lived the first eight years of your life and what you've been doing since you left Uravan?
GS: I was born in Grand Canyon, Arizona, in 1943. We lived there until I was about five years old, then we moved to Buckeye, Arizona, which is close to Phoenix and we lived around that area until I was approximately eight, I think. Before that, my father came to Colorado because he was crippled; he got--- ?--- by a mule at Grand Canyon and then he eventually
got Bergers disease and he was unable to work for a long time, so he came. My grandfather lived here, lived in Nucla, so my dad came up here to live. Then in approximately--it was about 1951, he came back and got us. My mother and sister and I came; we came to

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1 live in Uravan.
CE: GS:
CE: GS:
Was he working for Union Carbide then?
No, at that time he worked for the Centerville Trading Center, which is a store in Uravan and he also drove the high school bus from Uravan to Nucla each day and back again.
What are you doing now?
I presently am employed at Dixon Inc. Electronic Instrument Company. We make precision testing equipment, tachometers and other things for automobiles. I've been with Dixon since--well, for four years this July. Before that I was a missionary in Florida for eighteen months for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Before that, before I worked in Uravan the second time I was in California for a year working at the main company doing various things.
Do you want to go back now to when you moved to
Uravan and to your first impressions? Can you remember what you thought when you moved to this small mining town?
CE:
GS: Well the very first impression I had of Uravan was before we ever got there. I couldn't say the name and I thought it was so funny, it was the weirdest name I've ever heard. I tried to tell my teachers in
2

 GERMAINE S T E E L E # 1
Arizona and they couldn't understand me either. So we came, it took us--it seemed like it took us forever to get there and we got to this--it was a little town, it's very small, and we went to the Flat Tops where my dad had an apartment for us, which is a housing development. I suppose it was put up by the
company. I'm sure it was, because they regulated who lived there. It's like a giant duplex. I guess there are probably ten or twelve apartments in one grouping, and there were about eight or ten groupings of apartments. They're all hooked together so they're probably flat tops because the roofs were flat. The first thing we did was we all went to bed, slept for a long time 'cause we--so late when we got there. Well, it wasn't really late, but we'd been driving for so long. I don't know right away, I guess we started, I started into school right away. My sister was four years younger than me so she was much too young. I can remember there weren't very many kids in my class. I don't know, maybe fifteen; I'm not too sure about that. I can't remember who the teacher was either; I just remember some of the kids. There was one girl named Winnie and we always called her Weenie
and things like that.
CE: You were in third grade?

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
GS: CE: GS:
Yes. I was in third grade.
Do you remember anything about your teacher?
Well, I don't know 'cause I usually can remember things. I should be able to remember who she is, but I can't. Who she was. I guess she was a good teacher, I don't know that either. I don't really--I don't really remember learning anything in the third grade; I'm sure I did, but (it's] just something you don't remember.
Do you remember you mother's reaction? Maybe not immediately, but as you progressed, as you continued to live in this town.
Well, I don't think my mother wanted to come in the first place. I guess she liked it all right, but she had to help my dad 'cause when he worked at the store
he was the janitor so he had to go to work really early in the morning to be ready to drive the school bus to Nucla, which in those days took a long time
'cause the road wasn't paved and it was very curvy and old and it was kind of frightening actually. So my mother helped my dad. He cleaned the store and the drugstore. He also had to clean the Recreation Hall after it had been used. At that time they had movies there twice a week, which was a good idea. He also had to clean the boardinghouse at that time too, so
CE:
GS:

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
he had a lot of work to do and my mother helped my dad. I can't remember her reactions towards my
schooling if there was any. I guess I was doing alright; I seemed to be smart enough to do the work. I think most of my teachers throughout grade school were good; some of them were--! can remember a few that were rather eccentric. There was one music teacher that was really kind of a kook, she was an old maid and she just had some different ideas. There was another old maid school teacher that was pretty old, I don't know how old she was. I suppose she wasn't over the age limit, but she had some different ideas too. She had the idea that anything you wanted to know you could look up in the encyclopedia and find it and she was disappointed when you couldn't, which you couldn't most of the things you wanted to know.
CE: Did you ever hear any comments about how it was difficult to get teachers there or were teachers readily available at Uravan?
GS: I don't know. I don't think I heard anything. We always had teachers. I recall there was one teacher, I didn't have her, but she was there, and she was living with a man she wasn't married to in a company
house, which we all thought was rather interesting 5

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
because they didn't kick her out of town. But it's been heard to say you know she had affairs with various men, so I guess that's probably why she was allowed to stay. But I think we always had plenty of teachers and they seemed to be pretty good. I don't know anything about the pay situation; I know that the Superintendent of Schools that came--! don't know what year he came in but his name was Miller. I understood that he had been kicked out of another town but they brought him there. This is purely gossip. I ,couldn't prove any of it. But they brought him there because he was good at juggling books and he was there for a long time. He was the first principal. Then he became the Superintendent of the Schools in Uravan.
CE: There was more than one school?
GS: No. I don't even know why they had a Superintendent,
but they did.
CE: What do you mean by juggling books?
GS: Well, that I don't know either, but that's what my
mother always said and somebody else. Apparently financially, something to do with the school. I don't know. After a period of time, let's see, I was
probably about fourth grade they started or fifth they started building on. They moved the old
6

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
schoolhouse across the street where it still is located and they used i t for var ious things. They built a new modern building which was nice; everybody liked that. It's still there. Then they eventually built a gymnasium across the street where the old school building is also, which is a real large building that's just like one they have in Naturita they built. Of course they're all in the same school district so--
CE: Was there much emphasis on sports? Do you remember? GS: Yeah, we were always doing something. We had games between Naturita, Nucla, Norwood and Paradox. So the
school participated in all the sports you know, football and--well, eventually they had football. At first they didn't, and basketball, there wasn't a great deal of emphasis on softball, I don't think. But I remember we've always had basketball games.
CE: You went through eighth grade in Uravan and then were bussed to Nucla for high school?
GS: That's right. Now it's not that way anymore. They go somewhere else for the ninth grade or they have a Junior High. I'm not sure how it works, I think they
go to Naturita. It's kind of interesting, I think they bus a lot of kids that it really isn't necessary to do but--
7

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
CE:
GS:
Was there a Uravan contingent? Were you always conscious that this was the Uravan group even though you were all part of one high school at Nucla?
No, I don't think so. I really don't think so because I know I had friends from all the towns around 'cause all the towns go to the same school, so I don't really think so. There weren't too many students in high school. I don't imagine there were over three hundred anyway if that many. That's probably exag-- Four grades?
Yeah, all four grades. So there weren't--I think when I graduated there were probably thirty five or forty kids in our graduating class, so it wasn't that big of a school. Most all the kids know each other. It's not that way; we didn't fight among ourselves, which is interesting that we didn't. I guess we all got the school spirit and we knew we were there together.
What kind of school activities did you have besides sports?
Occasionally we went on nature hikes and things like that and we had parties sometimes. I don't know, I
guess just normal things that kids have.
Was it difficult because you had to commute? When you had to catch a bus at a certain time so you could
CE: GS:
CE:

CE:

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
participate in the activit ies at the high school?--- ?--- that?
GS: Well, you could. Most of them, except sometimes in the evenings unless you had somebody that was willing to take you. It's about sixteen miles; you couldn't go but--most of the things the kids could go to. There are a lot of opportunities that they have at larger schools that they don't have at small schools like Nucla. They don't have like, you know, swimming and tennis and a drama department and things like that. They don't have--they put on plays; we had class plays, but as far as taking drama as a subject you can't do that. We had a band which was, part of the time it was real good. They used to take us, the
Pep Club used to get to go to ball games out of town occasionally and the band used to travel too, with the football team. Mostly we had it real good I think; we had good teachers in high school. It's a fully accredited high school, which is probably interesting because the school at Norwood is not an accredited high school and it was one of our revivals. No that's not right, rivals. Right. In fact
they didn't like each other very much at all.
CE: Was there much emphasis on courses that would allow
one to ultimately get into college? 9

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
GS: Well, every year they have college days and the
professors or representatives from the different colleges would come and talk to the kids that were preparing. You know, tell them things that were necessary to get into college so that you could take the courses that you wanted to. The counselors, when you signed up, they tried to help you decide, you know, something. You knew what you wanted to be eventually, to take the courses that would help you in that life.
CE: So there were languages for instance and--
GS: Yes.
CE: And a full curriculum of sciences.
GS: Yes. They had chemistry and math and physics,
although chemistry and physics were offered every other year, not both in the same year. I think the same way with math too, Algebra I and II, I suppose were offered the same years, but some of the other math was offered at an off year, because I guess they couldn't get enough teachers or something. I don't really know why they did that.
CE: [What] did you have besides the band music courses? Did you have choir?
GS: Yes, we did eventually. While I was a Junior--perhaps while I was a Sophomore they organized a chorus as it
10

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
was called. I joined when I was sometimes to the other school--just the little towns you know, like-- well, we went to Naturita and went--I don't know if we went to anyplace else, but we did go to Naturi t a
once to perform and then we went to a contest at Durango and took part in that along with the band. We had opportunities to travel.
A state contest or with the district?
CE:
GS: Yes. I think it was in district where they--it's like
they have it down here also in Grand Junction, but our band went to Durango. I guess you could choose where you wanted to go 'cause they--I don't know if they felt it was better over there or what or if the band director and that was simply his choice 'cause they--we went there for three years anyway.
-CE: Where your labs adequately supplied?
GS: Well, that I don't know 'cause I didn't take any of
the science courses except for biology, but I think they probably had sufficient things to work with. The kids seemed to do alright that did take these courses.
CE: Does that apply to your eight years of, the years that you attended grade school at Uravan? Do you think that the school was supplied with adequate
materials or did you always feel that you were 11

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1 missing something?
GS: Well, as far as I know we had everything we needed. I don't really know, but I've never heard anybody saying, "We don't have such and such," so I guess we did have what we needed; I'm sure that there's a lot of things you could have that we probably didn't, but as far as--I think we were well taken care of in that line.
CE: Were you conscious of the fact that you lived in a company town?
GS: I don't really think so.
CE: You didn't feel--or Union Carbide wasn't felt. Is
that what you're saying?
GS: Well, I'm sure that it was, but I didn't feel
conscious of the fact that we owned the town so to speak. I'm sure that the adults probably were to a certain extent, because for a long time there was a class distinction. As children I don't think we felt it too much, but I know that they were told that the high-ups in the company were told not to party or have a great deal of association with the regular laborers; that they just didn't do this. That's what my father has told me, and I'm sure that that's right. So--but I don't know if it's the same now or not; I think everybody kind of gets together instead
12

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
of it being that way.
CE:
GS:
Did your father ever give you an explanation as to why they feel that way? Or give the directive?
Well, I guess they just didn't--you know, some people
feel that management shouldn't--it puts you on the wrong, puts you too far down, and then you're not the boss if you're on the level of the people. I think that's probably what they felt. I don't really know. He didn't say anything about that I know.
When would this have been when this attitude seemed to be prominent?
Well, it was in the early part of the time that I was there in the first few years. Probably my dad was there before we came up and I think it was prevalent then before we moved up to Uravan.
Maybe the first five years of 19--of the 1950s? That's possible. I don't really know that much about that part of it.
Do you remember whether there were any minority children in the school when you attended?
I don't believe that there were. There were some poor
people that lived up on Long Park, which is right above Uravan, I mean it's part of Uravan. The mill goes up on the mountain; that's called Long Park now. But I don't think they were mistreated. In fact, I
CE:

CE: GS:
CE:

13

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
can recall the teachers trying to help the children comb their hair and wash their faces because there-- one family of poor children didn't have a mother and they were all girls. There were about four girls. Their father of course didn't know much about taking care of them. They still live in Gateway now. There was another family that was quite large. I don't know how many children they had but well, it was rumored they had about fifteen and they didn't have much money either, but I don't think they were mistreated. Possibly by the children they were treated brutish. You know how kids are, they make fun of each other, but as far as the teachers or the adults treated them I think they treated them as equally as they could.
CE: Were these children of miners?
GS: Yes. They were. There weren't any colored children in
the school at all, in fact there are no colored people in Uravan to my knowledge or ever have been. There are a few Mexicans, but probably quite a few more now. I think there are Indians that live down there too, but at that time we didn't have any ·Indians in the school either. We had a few Mexicans but they were treated just like everybody else as long as they acted that way. 'Cause I can remember when I was in the eighth grade, this one girl got mad
14

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
at a Mexican girl and called her a "dirty Mexican" and immediately the teacher made her apologize in front of the class. So we weren't allowed to discriminate in any way, and I don't think the--most of us didn't think of it that way; she was just another one of our friends. As far as the company I don't think they discriminated against (anyone or had] any racial discrimination at all, either. I
really don't know, but I don't think that they did.
think. Then we moved to the Club Ranch which is about a mile from the Flat Tops which no longer exist because Union Carbide decided that they needed to make it into about three acid ports which they did. I feel it was really a bad thing to do because the ranch was a historical landmark and the house that we lived in my grandfather had lived in forty years before we did, which always impressed me. It was a really wonderful old place and they could have made a lot out of it had they wanted to, but they decided
that this was best. I guess I'm just sentimental. They destroyed that orchard. It was a large orchard with peaches and apple trees and cherry trees which were quite old. You could tell because they bore
Did you continue to live in the Flat Tops?
CE:
GS: We lived in the Flat Tops only about three years I
15

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
really good fruit, and they were large trees, so I just felt bad about the whole thing because I thought they'd done something they didn't need to and I still don't like them for it.
CE: What happened to the house?
GS: They tore it down. They tore all the houses down--
well, they sold one of them, but ours was the biggest one and it was really old; they just tore it down. I'm sure it wasn't any good, the lumber or anything. It's rather interesting, the walls, between the walls was packed with adobe mud which I suppose was for insulation. At one time the house had been--I don't know how they got ahold of it, but the Lions Club.was making it into a clubhouse and they had a giant fireplace put into one end of the house; this covered the whole end. The firebox part wasn't that large, but the whole--and it had uranium in it. Somebody stole some of it. We heard that they wanted to seat a claim with it, which I don't know is true or not, but there was a big hunk taken out before we moved in
which was there when we first looked at the house.
CE: How did you manage to get it?
GS: Well, Jerome Krieg had leased the ranch from Union
Carbide and he had run cows on it occasionally, but there was a large grazing area in the mountain by
16

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
this that came with the ranch, and that was basically why he wanted it. He did have a man t hat would ranch
it or farm it or whatever. They raised alfalfa there and some one of the men raised potatoes and different things like that. But we went to Jerome Krieg and my folks said, "We want to rent this house and we'11 stay there and we'll take care of the place for you," and so we got it. It was not a modern house. We hauled our water all the years that we lived there; we hauled it from a--Union Carbide had a place over by some of the houses where you could get water. It was where some of the trucks got water also.
CE: A Well. Was it a deep water well?
GS: I don't think so. I don't know what it was, but I
just know I don't think it was a well though. I just think it was something they put there where you could turn the water on and get the water 'cause we hauled our water from there. Also we had outdoor plumbing. Of course, if you don't have indoor water you don't
have any toilet either. There was a cistern there, but somebody had cut the pipes between our house and the cistern so that it was no longer usable. The cistern did connect to the other house and the people there could use it if they could get the water in it, which most of the time they did. So we lived there
17

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
for--oh, I don't know how many years; a long, long time. Then when Union Carbide decided to take down the ranch I guess they gave my folks a couple of months notice. Of course we couldn't believe it, but we eventually believed it and they moved to Naturita at that time; I stayed there and lived with a family that I knew real well because at that time I was working at the boardinghouse.
You had by then graduated from high school?
CE:
GS: Yes. And--
CE: When was this, Gerry?
GS: This was was in 1962 that I went to work in the
boardinghouse; I graduated in '61 but I was only seventeen so I couldn't get a job until I was eighteen. I applied at Union Carbide but I didn't have enough experience or something. Perhaps I didn't belong to the right family or something. I don't know. But anyway, I didn't get on there, but I did get on at the boardinghouse and I worked there for about seven months. Then I went to California. It was interesting work there as miners, truck drivers, mill workers ate at the boardinghouse. There's no place else in the whole country I think that you can get better food for what they paid 'cause I think it was- -let's see, it was $1.25 for breakfast and I think it
18

 GERMAINE was

supper and $1.00
two choices of meat, pot atoes and
were
vegetables and just anything you could pos s i bly want and it was good food. It was cooked well and i t was-- well, everybody that ate there loved and--
CE: Why did they have to do that Gerry? Why did they have to make it available?
GS: Well, I guess the company wanted the boardinghouse for the men because there were men there without their families; some were single men and so Centerville Trading Center was also in charge of the boardinghouse. They took care of it and they provided the food and all that. Of course I guess Carbide paid Pete Peters. I don't know how that worked at all, but I know that whenever they had the company picnics which they had twice a year that the food was prepared at the boardinghouse for these picnics.
There was always plenty of it and it was the best stuff. You know, they prepared good stuff for their people.
CE: Mr. Peters I think leases the buildings and then has these concessions.
GS: Uh, uh. I guess that's the way it works.
CE: I've been trying to get a hold of him and I've not succeeded yet. I hope that I do before I go to Uravan
19

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
because it would be helpful to talk to him before I go. Do you think the general living conditions were good?
Yes. I think so. I think the company tried to take care of the housing. Every year or so they painted
GS:
CE: GS:
all the houses, and if you had something wrong with your house they'd fix it for it. They took---?--- Did you have to pay?
No, not now. This is in the Flat Tops or the other housing. There's no--they took care of it. Like if the screens got ripped or things like that I'm sure that they took care of then and it didn't cost the people anything. The cost of housing was very inexpensive.
For instance, what did you pay for your apartment?
I suppose we paid about--I don't know, but it was probably $25 a month. It may have been less; I don't really know. But I know that some most of the housing it just was not that much, you know, they pay thirty, forty, fifty dollars a month. Maybe not even fifty
and some, the company did build new houses which are really nice houses and they weren't like the Flat Tops; they weren't together or anything. They have put up a lot of houses while we lived there. In fact they took part of the Club Ranch grazing area and put
CE: GS:
20

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
houses in there; they also took part of it and made a swimming pool later on, which is real close to the acid pots now. It's only a few hundred feet from it. Is there an odor?
CE: GS:
CE:
GS:
CE: GS:
CE: GS: CE:
GS:
I don't really know; I've never gone swimming there since I left.
How much did you have to pay up at the house you had on the Club Ranch?
We paid $30 a month. Which I guess--they wanted fifty but my folks talked them out of it.
Does Union Carbide maintain that too then?
No. They didn't have anything to do with that because Jerome Krieg leased it so he had it.
You sort of leased it then?
Yeah, sort of. Just rented it actually.
Did you notice that while you were there the miners seemed to be of a certain type? Do you understand what I mean by type?
Yes, I understand what you mean, but I don't know if they were or not. A lot of them were in it for the
money I think; they didn't have enough education to do anything else, but I don't mean they were dumb or anything. But it was good money I understand. From what I hear it still is real good money if you can stand it. So I don't know if they were necessarily of
21

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
a certain type or not; many of them had families. Now a lot of the miners--some of them I guess lived in the Flat Tops but I don't know. I don't think all of them did. I mean, I think there were. You had to get on a list to get in there; the company had a list, so a lot of the people that lived there weren't miners but they were company employees of some other nature. The miners definitely didn't 1ive in the real good
company housing. They didn't; that was all there was to it; that was saved for the people that worked in the mill I guess.
CE: Or maybe management.
GS: Right. Yes. There were a lot of houses there, really
quite a few.
CE: Were you conscious of the fact that the mill
dominated the scene?
GS: I don't know. I guess you always knew it was there
'cause it was--in the old days it was really working and there was smoke coming out of all the stacks and things like. These days you know it's just--no, most of the work is done on top of the hill rather than down the hill. Straight down where you can see it. I guess you always knew it was there.
CE: Did you play in the tailings?
GS: No, no. As far as I know none of the kids did. They
22

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
weren't--! don't know that we ever wanted to.
CE: But they were there?
GS: Yeah, but there was mostly one place where they were
and it was a restricted area.
CE: Why was it restricted, do you recall?
GS: Golly, I don't know. They just didn't want you in
there, I guess. It wasn't like a place you'd want to play anyway 'cause you know a lot of time this tailing stuff was running into watery stuff, whatever
it was. They'd let a man with a caterpillar get out there, spread it all around after it dried and stuff like that. Occasionally you saw some kids out there, but most of the time you didn't. There were other things to do besides get in there. We used to play outside, play cowboys and Indians and things like that. We didn't have any real reason to get into that. I never thought much about that before. Then I guess some of it where they built some of the houses they used tailings to fill in the ground. That's what--I'm sure they did; I can remember them doing it. But grass still grows there, so it must not be too bad, the texture of the earth or whatever it is.
CE: By the time you were there the Public Health Service had already begun to warn the public, the miners, the companies that radiation did provide a health hazard.
23

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
Do you remember any warnings like that being given to any of the people at Uravan?
GS: Not really. I can remember eventually they talked about radiation but I don't think we--anyway, the people that I was associated with--thought much about it really. We thought it was sort of a new thing to us. I guess [we never] thought it would hurt us or anything. But I know that it's an unhealthy place to live. There are many people that are ill that live there. And--
CE: What do you mean ill?
GS: Well, they're just kind of sickly. I know this one
lady that lived there. She's still sickly. I don't know if it's because of Uravan or not but I really don't think that it's a healthy place to live because of the radiation and the things. I'm sure that the smoke and stuff that comes from the plant sort of-- some of the time it just hangs over the town a little bit. Of course that's mostly when the humidity is heavy when it can't rise. Well, I really shouldn't say that's unhealthy 'cause I don't know for positive fact, but I don't think that it's a good place to live. I wouldn't want to go back, only to visit there
or something.
CE: Because it concerns you?
24

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
GS: Well, I don't know. Partially that and partially

because I don't feel there's anything there anymore; there's no reason to go there. There are still people that I know there, but I just do [feel that way]. I'm kind of odd and I just don't know. Some people I just don't bother with so to speak.
Do you think that some of the people who have ·lived there for a long time such as the Schmultz's family who were moved out of their houses because they learned that there was a very high working level present, radiation level?
Oh, really?
Do--you didn't know the Schmultz's?
Oh, yes, I do know the Schmultz's. She's the biggest gossip in the whole town. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but that's true, and she knows everybody's business and what she doesn't know she makes up.
Well, the Schmultz's moved from their house and their two daughters lived in this house for many years I
understand. Now one of these daughters has a child and this family is being studied by the Public Health Service to determine whether there was enough radiation exposure to be harmful to either the third

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
had eczema or something, some kind of a skin disease. I'm sure that's what it was, and if perhaps this is related you don't know? She was always kind of odd, I mean not really; peculiar I guess. She also is going to have another child.
CE: Do you remember whether there were many mine accidents while you were there or any other accidents that were related to the mill or to the mines?
GS: There were a couple, I--there was a man that I know got hurt. He got electrocuted I believe. There was another man that got hurt somehow; this was in the mill, it wasn't in the mines. I don't remember really any mine accidents. I suppose there were some I don't remember, but I don't think they had very many accidents. I remember we always had safety programs at school and they showed us movies and passed out T- shirts and things like that so we were conscious of safety and how important it was. There were a few accidents but only a couple. This one man died. I don't think the other one did. That's all I remember about that.
CE: Do you remember whether the mill workers and miners got good medical attention?
GS: I'm sure that they did. There was one doctor that they had in Uravan that we didn't think much of. I
26

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
don't know if everybody felt like we did or not; he was a reformed alcoholic turned preacher-doctor who really thought he was a better man than a lot of people, especially the poor, the poorer people I would say. But I think that most of all they got good health treatment because the doctor's fees were
low and they always provided a physical for the men that worked in the mill. I'm sure they didn't pay for that; I'm sure the company did. I don't know how many times a year they had it, but I think it was at least once a year.
CE: Was your dad included in any of this?
GS: No, he wasn't because he didn't work for Carbide
directly. He tried to get on but he couldn't. I guess he couldn't pass the physical because of he was crippled, because of his legs.
CE: Was Dr. Ellenwood there while you were there?
GS: Yes. He was. We were still there when he left. So he
was a good doctor.
CE: Were you conscious of the fact that he was very
active working with the radiation problem and with
the victims of cancer?
GS: No, I don't know a thing about that.
CE: The lung cancer problems.
GS: Oh, I remember one time that before we lived on the
27

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
Club Ranch there was a medical team of some sort that came in and took x-rays of all the miners and I suppose they took some other kinds of tests of them too. They were there about a week or so; they didn't come back anymore, but they were there that one time. It was to see the effects of radiation and I guess the dust the lungs and stuff like that. I remember that; I don't know if Union Carbide had them come in or if it was just Public Health Service or what it was.
CE: Did you ever hear the miners talking about this or the fellows whom you fed at the boardinghouse?
GS: No. I don't recall them talking about it. I don't think the people were greatly concerned at that time about it. It's just like now we suddenly realize what a problem that air pollution is, it's just like suddenly it's here and we didn't ever realize it before. I think that's the way it was there, that nobody realized that we were living in a dangerous area, that radiation was bad or something. We knew it, or weren't even interested probably to, you know, find out that any such thing was even around.
CE: One of the people whom I interviewed said that on a hot summer's night as he looked up toward the mines above the mills he could see a faint glow and he said
28

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
of course, he knew and everyone else knew that it was radiation from the tailings. He said people just didn't even talk about it. Do you remember that?
GS: Well, I don't remember it at all. I don't remember ever hearing of it even. It's possible that it was there, I'm sure, but none of the people I ever talked to I'm sure said anything about that.
CE: That might be an interesting question for you to ask some of these people who lived there a long time, whether they were conscious of this. You mentioned something about poverty earlier. Were there a lot of poor people? I mean poor people, people who were in dire need of assistance?
GS: No, there weren't--I don't think there were very many. There might have been a few families of miners that were that way, but they were paid well I'm sure the ones--well, there were a few people that lived up there that weren't miners. I don't even think they worked for Carbide. I don't know what they did, they were just up there or else they worked for mines that--well, some of the mines were run by Carbide I
think and the others weren't. Perhaps they worked for some of the other mines and didn't make as much or something. I don't know.
CE: Independent contractors, hired miners maybe that ' s 29

 GERMAINE STEELE #1 who they were.
GS:
Maybe that's who they were working for. There weren't really a lot of poor people. Most I guess everybody was just kind of--of course there were people that had more than others, a lot more, but most of the people were middle-class I guess. They had about the same, some had more.
What do you remember about the company store?
We went there every single solitary day. And--
What?
Oh, I don't know, we just did. My mother always wanted to visit; she visited everybody in the store and we always went to get the papers at the drugstore and visit there too. My mother's a great visitor and
I guess everybody went to the store every once and a while. You don't have to go to the store there, but it's closer than anywhere else, especially for a long time the road between Uravan and anywhere else was terrible so it was like going on a long journey if you went someplace else. So it was easier to stay there, buy what they had at the store. I guess they had most of the things that you needed.
Did they?
Yeah, I think so, and if they didn't have it they'd order if for you, I'm sure they would. When
CE: GS: CE: GS:

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
eventually they built on to the store and put on a bigger clothing department and stuff like that in, I can't remember when they did that, but they did it after a few years.
You mean the prices were equal to those of other places in the area, or were they higher or lower?
CE:
GS:
I don't know. I think that they were probably about the same. I think the prices throughout that area are high through all those towns because there's no competition. I mean sometimes they lower the prices and have a sale just to get people in, but I think basically--well, I know that the prices in Naturita and Nucla are ridiculous and I'm sure they're probably the same in Uravan. 'Cause they can get them; you've got to eat and you have to pay the price, but I couldn't really say how they were at that time, how high the prices were 'cause I don•t remember that much about it.
The quality of the products were you think good?
Yes, I think so. I think good. We had the things that we needed and they were good things, I'm sure that they were.
Did you ever hear any comments from your parents or
your neighbors about the fact that they might have resented having only one store from which to buy
CE: GS:
CE:
31

 GERMAINE S T E E L E # 1 their necessities?
GS:
No, I don't think so. They realized that this is the way it had to be and that's the way it was. If they wanted to go somewhere else they could if they wanted to spend the money and take the time. I guess a lot of them probably did travel; some came down here. Of course it was a long ways down here 'cause the road wasn't finished to Grand Junction either. Only part way.
Did they use script?
No, they used your money. Used money. Of course I knew they never used script, but if they did it was more before my time.
Did you feel that there was a community spirit among the people?
I don't know, I never thought much about that till I read that paper.
Did they all seem to want to do things together like go on picnics on Friday night together or participate in the recreation center activities?
I don't know. I don't think so, not necessarily, but
we did have Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts and things like that and they had a library where you could get books. The books were brought in from the Denver Library too for a couple of weeks. So that was good.

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
They have a lot of books in the library and I don't know if they really worked together as a community or not. I wasn't conscious of that, but I suppose that they did do it. They had PTA meetings and things like that.
Was there participation from all walks of life in
CE:
GS:
this? I meant to ask you this earlier when you were talking about your schools. Did the parents seem to take an interest in their children's activities in the school?
I think most of them did. Yes, because we used to have the Christmas program and some other kind of program; there were always a lot of parents there. Some people don't care anyway, but they were always a lot of good for morale--
Good for morale --?-- miners up through the management?
Everybody.
What social activities were there for the adults? Do you remember?
Well, for a long time there were movies you know every week, but then when television came in--they finally got television down there--people quit going to the show and finally they didn't have them
anymore. They haven't had it for a long, long time. 33
CE:
GS: CE:
GS:

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
But it wasn't--I can't remember, it was fifty cents for the adults, so it wasn't very expensive. When I first started going to the movie it only cost me nine cents, so that was an inducement, wasn't it?
CE: Yeah, it sure was.
GS: All you had to do was talk your mother into taking
you.
CE: You had to have adult supervision?
GS: No, we just had to get there because where we lived
was least a mile from town, and when we moved in the Club Ranch it was about two miles. So we couldn't walk, and if nobody took you couldn't go. But, they used to have dances every once and a while too. [They] still do, with the adults, and they had dances in Newport too and people went up there to dance Saturday nights. They had a town hall up there where they had dances. Of course they had dances in the Rec. Hall at Uravan too. At that time they still held church in the Recreation Hall, there was a little church over by the schoolhouse but I don't even know what group it belonged to. There weren't very many people that went there and there weren't at-- eventually the Episcopalian--well, somehow they got together and started having church down by the Flat Tops. There was a building down there and they
34

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
had church down there. I don't know if they still do or not. We always had church, it was j us t a community church sort of thing.
CE: Gerry, do you remember whether you had a police department while you were in Uravan?
GS: No, we didn't. When I think about it I don't know what we had, but I know we didn't have a police department, we didn't have a town cop or anything. I don't know who was in charge of law enforcement. I guess there wasn't much to enforce actually.
Everybody behaved themselves pretty well, but we didn't have anybody. There was a Sheriff's Posse, but they belonged to I don't know what; they didn't go out and arrest people. I don't know what they did, except I know once there was a mountain lion on the hill and they all went up there to get it, but they didn't get it. It got away, but I don't think we had any problem with law enforcement that I can remember. -Now you might get some inforrnation from somewhere else on that, because I don't remember anybody. I remember there was a game warden that came into town but he didn't have anything to do with enforcing the law except for his standpoint, you know, to come--!
guess he caught people poaching and things like that. CE: Was t h a t common?
35

 GERMAINE S T E E L E # 1
GS: I think it was a lot more common that perhaps people
realized because there's a lot of hunting area around there and I think a lot of people--and they still do live in those areas--poach. I don't think a lot them got caught; the game warden never knew it because I know that there are people there now that get meat over [at] Dale Reevely's all year round and I'm sure they were a few that it went to.
CE: How do you feel about that?
GS: I think it's wrong. I think if they're starving and
you don't have any food that's a different story, but these people I know they're eating the meat and I know that they think they're doing right, but to me it's wrong. We're suppose to obey the laws and if they can't get it during hunting season they can just do without. There's a lot of them that get it during the hunting season, but they get more than their share. I think that's wrong too. That's my personal opinion. I know the game warden told my dad, he said, 11If you get starved and you don't have anything to eat, you just let me know and I' 11 bring you some. 11 He that was one that used to be there; he was a really nice guy. But whenever they found somebody with illegal meat I guess they gave it to the school,
not necessarily the school in Uravan, but they gave 36

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
it to the school in Nucla. I guess they fed it to the kids.
CE: You probably had a lunch program, didn't you?
GS: Yes. When I first went to school there we didn't have it I don't think, but we eventually had it and we
went to that before they got the new school finished. Every day at noon we walked down to the recreation hall, and that's where we had lunch too. Before they got the new school finished also they held classes in the Recreation Hall in the basement of it; we had school down there for quite a while. That's where we had the hot lunch program. Then when they got the new school finished, got the gymnasium finished that's where they had the hot lunch program, in there. They had the kitchen and all that so kids could eat there, but I remember there were some kids that were poor because I remember the kids that brought lard sandwiches for lunch and I always felt bad for them because that was awful.
CE: What do you mean? I don't understand what do you mean by large sandwiches.
GS: Lard.
CE: Oh, lard!
GS: Yeah, that's all they had. Their bread had lard on
it; that's what they said anyway so they were poor. 37

You don't remember whether there was any welfare program for any of these people?
I don't know if they had it fixed so they didn't have to pay for their lunch or not and I don't know about welfare from the state or anything like that. I don't know why they were so poor, but they were.
Where did you go to church? You mentioned that there was a church.
Well, when I went I went there.
Was it non-denominational?
Yes, right. It was just there was a--I don't know, I suppose the preacher came from---?--- I guess just a group. I don't really know much about that. except that they had different preachers at different times and it was O.K. We had Sunday School and things like that. They had activities and they always had a Bible School every summer. I always went to Bible School, so they always had that. A lot of kids went to that; most of the kids went.
Did you use the school then for that?
No, we used to use the Recreation Center until finally they used the school. That was the last year that I went. I was a helper when they used the school then, but I can't remember how old I was. I was
probably twelve, eleven or twelve, something 1ike 38
CE: GS:

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1 that.
CE: What did you do at the boardinghouse? Specifically. GS: Well, I first worked there the first time--I worked there twice. The first time I worked there I waited tables: waiting tables is not like a restaurant, you just put the food on. They either (eatJ it or go without. You know, they don't say, "I want so and so." There's always plenty of it: you keep the dishes filled up, and then we always took the dishes off the table after they were finished and washed them and then the tables were reset for the next meal •cause-- well, there was a lot of work to do. Then I worked in the mornings and I worked at night. I didn't work at noon because there weren't too many men that ate lunch at noon. A lot of them took lunches and we made the lunches in the morning: I used to go to work about six o'clock. The cook lived at the boardinghouse. He was a man--at that time it was a
man cook and he lived there.
CE: How many people lived there?
GS: Right in the boardinghouse there were probably maybe
five or six, but see the company has bunkhouses. They still have bunkhouses, and that's where most of the men lived. Then the truck drivers, some of them lived in the bunkhouses too. Some of them, I don't know
39

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
where the rest of them lived. I guess all of them must have lived in the bunkhouses or else they lived
in a different town and just ate on their way through or something. But then at that time I worked there we were responsible for cleaning the boardinghouse also or the part where the food was. We didn't clean the other rooms; they had a maid that did that. She also cleaned the bunkhouses, but every week we had to wash, mop the floor, and sometimes we waxed it. It was hot in the kitchen because they didn't have an air conditioner. All they had was a fan they pulled the smoke out [with] and stuff; it wasn't really smokey, but just pulled the fumes out, and it was hot in there in the summer. When I worked there the second time they called me while I was in California 'cause I'd been home for a week and told my dad if I could get a job I'd come back to Uravan. I don't know why I said that, but anyway I did, and so they called me and they said, "We need somebody right away, but
you'll have to cook too." "I don't know how to cook!" "W ell," they said, "you' 11 only have to cook in the mornings and on the weekends you'11 have to take turns with the other women." So at that time the man
cook was gone; he'd quit and gone somewhere else. CE: When was this, Gerry?
40

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
GS: This was in 1963 I think.
CE: Had the population decreased by then?
GS: Yes. There weren't as many people that ate in the
boardinghouse. Not nearly as many.
CE: Or lived in the town?
GS: Well, yeah. I don't think that many lived in the town
any more either. There were still quite a few, but a
lot of the Flat Tops were empty.
CE: So you felt the boom in the fifties; you knew that
there was a mass production of uranium.
GS: I guess so, I you know when you're a kid you're not really conscious of it I guess, but there was a lot
of activity around there.
CE: You probably heard your dad talking about it?
GS: Yeah, I guess so, I don't know. I know I used to go
to work with him sometimes when he would haul water for the drill rigs, and that was always interesting. They were finding uranium you know. I guess because there were a tot of people working and a lot of things going on I guess we weren't conscious of it, I don't know. It was just kind of a fun place to be at
that time with all the kids and there--
CE: Excuse me. Go ahead.
GS: No, you go ahead. I forgot what I was going to say. CE: Were you conscious of people walking down the street
41

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
busy and going somewhere? I'm trying to visualize this now as a town or something different. Did you see people walking down the street on their way to performing a certain type of business?
Well, they could be walking between the store, the drugstore and the post office, but that's about it. There's nowhere else to go.
So there's not that type of activity in the town?
No. No 'cause the buildings aren't very far apart and there's j ust--you see people, but you know they' re usually going to the store or that's the only place they could go are those three places. Some people you could see walking down to the offices of Union Carbide, but that wasn't very often. Most everybody drove down there, except at noon time when the men got off work a lot of them went home for lunch and then you would see a lot of activity, a lot of cars and stuff, but other than that it isn't a busy bustling little town. It wasn't then.
Were there many women who were working? Or weren't there very many jobs?
The only jobs--let's see, there were a few women that worked in the store, probably three or four, and only about three maybe that worked in the drugstore. I
mean there were high school girls that worked there 42
GS:
CE: GS:
CE:
GS:

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
after school and some women employed at the Union Carbide offices, and I think there were a couple in the Post Office, but there really weren't very many.
'Cause just 1ike you said there weren't the jobs and I don't know if they were necessarily looking for work.
CE: I'm interested in pursuing now the influences of Union Carbide on Uravan. Obviously it's vast because it owns the town, but what I want to know is how and where it was felt. Do you think that the company had any influence over the teachers in the school or the School Board? If you weren't conscious of it while you were going there through eighth grade did you
hear people talking about this?
GS: Well, I don't know. I suppose they did have influence
on the teachers, but I don't think--you know, I don't think they tried to tell them what to teach or anything like that. Now I'm sure that most of the people on the School Board since they were Montrose County they were not from Uravan; they were from Montrose. I 'm sure they were, and so I think the decisions about how the school was run were made in
Montrose rather than in Uravan. I don't know if Carbide had a great deal to say about it. I'm sure that if they wanted to they did, but I even think the
43

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
teachers were hired by Montrose rather than Uravan. In fact, I'm sure of it, because I can remember that the superintendent at that time was a lady in Montrose and she came to visit the school every once
CE: GS:
CE:
GS: CE:
GS:
in a while, so I really don't think Union Carbide had a lot to do with ·the school. I don't know, but I don't think they did. They probably put up some of the money for the new school. I don't even know that for sure.
They donated the land.
Did they? I guess they must have, because it belongs to them.
They are very high taxpayers in the county needless to say, a company as large as that--
Right.
Were the schools the center of the community life do you think?
I don't know, I suppose that they were during the school year. Yeah, because some of the people came out and supported the teams and stuff like that. Of course most of the people were at work so--but I don't know; I think most all of the people that lived there had children going to school, so they were interested to a degree. I know that a lot of the
parents, the mothers especially were in PTA 44

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
organization deciding this and that. Something else I guess.
CE: Do you remember whether the company provided the school employees their housing?
GS: Yes, I think that they did. I don't know, I think they had to pay, but I know some of the teachers lived in the Flat Tops and that.
CE: Did any of your friends or classmates go on to college or did lots of them go back to the mines as their fathers did?
GS: Well, most of the kids--I don't think any of the kids I went to school with live in Uravan anymore. I know most sure that they don't. Some of the kids I went to high school with live in Nucla, but they were kids from Nucla, and there are some kids still in Naturita but very, very few. There's nothing there. I suppose it's less that 1% even that stayed around that area. In my class I don't know any of the kids in my class that worked in the mines. As far as I know they
don't. They're mostly all gone. So the ones that live in Nucla are farmers or something like that, have something to do with that or I guess that's what the the ones that I know do. But there aren't very many
that stay around.
CE: And you go to the area often enough so that you would
45

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
be conscious of who did what?
GS:
Right. Because we had a class reunion two summers ago. We only had about eight people at the reunion, so I guess most of them were from that area, around there, but they weren't mine workers. I know one of them is--well, one of the girls, her husband is a schoolteacher. The other girl, her husband is the highway patrol--he's not the town cop but he's highway patrol. The other girl, her husband's father owns the gas station and a sort of gas company.
And this is in Nucla?
Yes, in Nucla.
Nucla's what about eighteen, nineteen miles away? Yes, something like that.
Naturita's about fourteen miles away?
That's about right.
Did many of them go to college?
Well, I think quite a few of them did.
Out of the thirty-five now that graduated?
Uh huh.
Do you have any idea how many? Can you estimate? Well, I don't know. Let's see--some of them started
but didn't finish, but there are--I don't even know where all of them are, but quite a few of them did. I couldn't really say 'cause I don't know; some of the

 GERMAINE STEELE #1
kids went away and we never heard from them again. There's some of them--I don't know.
Do you think that the reason that you're not conscious of what happened to these people is because
CE:
GS:
that was kind of a transient community? The boom years brought so many people, and then when the demand for uranium decreased people began to move away. Do you understand what I'm trying to derive? Yes, I do. Right. But I don't know because I'm trying to think. Now there were a lot of kids that rode this bus from Uravan to Nucla that I did not---?--- and I, I was---?---. But some of the kids, their parents still live there but the kids are gone, so I don't know if it's necessarily because the boom was off or not. I think there were only maybe six or seven of us from Uravan that were in my class; there weren't very many. In one family the man's retired now and they live down here; one of the boys' dad still lives there, and another family still lives there. The mother's a teacher and the man works at Carbide and they still live there.
Where does the mother teach?
She teaches at the grade school in Uravan. Oh. What's their name?
Kimbler.
CE: GS: CE: GS:
47

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
CE: Mrs. Kimbler.
GS: Uh huh. They've been there a long time. And there's
another one of the teachers [who] still teaches there. Her name's Daisy Dale, and her husband works for Carbide too. She's been there for a long time. I saw her down here in the store the other day, and she asked me if I remembered her and I said, "Yes, but I don't know what your name is." And she told me. They're still there. So I think the reason the kids in my class left is simply because there wasn't anything there for them. Some of them you know--none of the kids from my class as far as I know went to Carbide now. The ones that are still in that area up there are doing something else.
CE: Do you think that it was kind of a transient community? People were moving in and out, there was never a feeling of permanence or a feeling of belonging on the part of residents?
GS: Well, I know there were a lot of people moving in and out quite often for a while. For a while it seemed stable and I seemed to know almost everybody, but then suddenly I didn't know anybody anymore it seemed like. A lot of the people were gone, so of course a lot of the management personnel got transferred
someplace else on occasion; different ones were in 48

 GERMAINE STEELE # 1
and out so--I suppose it was quite a bit of people moving in and out. I don't know whether we felt stable or not, but I guess we did because we were going to be there forever anyway. But a lot of people didn't stay long. Yeah, I remember som e--that's probably the way it was because some of my friends
were there for a couple of years, three or four mayb~, two or three, then they were gone but never came back.
CE: Did you ever remember any incidents regarding the Unions?
GS: Well, I do, but I don't know what it was that was going on. I can remember them having meetings and discussing things. They never went on strike as far as I know. I think they discussed it one time, but I--

this was when I was working at the boardinghouse and I can remember they were going to have a Union meeting or something, I think that's what I remember. But I don't really--I know that they have a Union and

that they met about once a month or so, but I don't know what they did in their meetings or if they really had a great deal of influence in the mill.
CE: Do you remember any Union leaders, anyone whom I'd like to talk with when I go there?
GS: Well, I know there is a man that lives down here that was in the Union. I don't know if he was a leader but he was in it. His name's Kenneth Stephens. s-t-e-p-h- e-n. His number's in the phone book I'm sure. 'Cause
I can remember---?--- but I don't know, I guess they elected different people at different times to be in it.
CE: But you don't remember any particular individual who might have been very influential who's still there?
GS: No, but if you talk to my folks I'm sure they can tell you of someone because they remember these things and they were interested in them more than I was. Just, you know, I was growing up.
CE: What about politics? Were you ever conscious of the political aspects of the town of Uravan? Did you ever hear any discussions about, "They're all Democrats or they're all Republicans in this town?"
GS: No, I don't think so. I'm sure that the--I can remember when they had the elections people went to the Recreation Hall and voted, but I can't remember
50

that. There weren't any town officials so to speak, so we didn't have anything like that. We voted for county judges and things like that, so I don't know.
I don't think I ever heard anybody really discussing
---?---
CE: So there really wasn't a democratic system in the
town so to speak because the personnel managers resolved the problems of the company. Isn't that right?
GS: Yeah, I guess that's right. I remember there were personnel. Yeah, they decided kind of who got the housing and things like that.
CE: Was there much resentment among the women regarding that?
GS: Sometimes there was. They got mad because they wanted a certain house or they were out in the western division. I think there was sort of politics there, not Republican-Democrat thing, but a company sort of thing and who got the house. I'm sure that that's the way the half mile because people wanted some, so and so, and they didn't get it, they got something else.
Somebody else got the two-bedroom and they were only
going to get a one-bedroom. Things like that.
CE: Did the women seem satisfied with the houses?
GS: I think so because most of the houses were nice, they
51

 GERMAINE S T E E L E # 1
were all nice and there were a lot of new ones-- different kinds of houses you know. There were some
---?--- huts in one place and they were nice too and all sorts of things. They're still there-- there were some, some of the housing was you know sort of better than the other housing. People were ritzy that lived there, but I'm sure they were satisfied with what they had most generally.
CE: You said your dad worked for Mr. Peters. Do you remember the conditions under which Mr. Peters leased them, store leased for you dad? Are you familiar with any of that? You don't remember your father talking about that?
GS: No, I don't know anything about that.
CE: Are there any trees and parks in Uravan?
GS: There are trees; there aren't any parks, but there
are a lot of trees. It's a real nice little town. They were always concerned about planting trees and things like that. I think they had rules about keeping your yard nice, and I'm sure they do in most of the housing areas. At least most of the people do it too; they don't allow you to clutter your back yard with a lot of campers and things like that, but you don't see much junk. I don't think the company allows it. I know even the Flat Tops now they're
52

tearing them down a lot of them that they're painted, they look nice even though they're boarded up. People don't live in them, very many of them. They are tearing some of them down. They keep it looking nice. Now every year they paint the buildings in the town
CE:
or every two years anyway, you know, like the store and the drugstore. I think the company does that. I'm sure they do, they furnished the paint, the labor for them.
Did you ever sense that people took for granted these
services that the company provided?
GS: Oh. I'm sure they did. I don't really, I'm not
conscious of thinking about it even though I'm sure they do. Took it for granted, and I remember when the company put the gas stove in the Flat Tops to the gas lines---?--- They really tried to improve things. I think if you wanted to paint the inside of your house that I'm sure they provided paint for you if you wanted to do the work on it. It may not have been so; I'm sure the paint they provided was water base and if you wanted something else you bought it yourself,
which my folks did the time they painted the house, the Flat Top we lived in but--it was sort of a manager of the Flat Tops I think, somebody that was in charge. You went to that person and talked to them

if you wanted something for your house, and I guess he got it from the company. I don't know.
CE: Is there anything else that you would like to contribute before we conclude, anything you remember that you think would be significant as far as providing a better understanding for anybody who might be listening to this? Because you should probably know there aren't too many company towns in our country.
GS: I guess not. I never really thought about it.
CE: And many of them are dying, those that have existed primarily because communications are better, people are able to commute from larger areas to a mine or
whatever---?--- the creation of a company town.
GS: Well, I always think that basically the people there were well treated by the department. I don't really know the underlying feelings of a lot of people and what was really going on, you know. There are always
things going on you don't know anything about. If you could get into the heart of it you would know. 'Cause I'm sure they had troubles in the mill just like they do today between personalities ---?--- things like that. It seems 1ike things went O.K. They tried to get along with you.
CE: And generally people were happy, you think? 54

 GERMAINE S T E E L E # 1 GS: Oh, I think--
CE: ---?---
GS: I think the majority of them were. As far as I know
they were. You know there weren't a lot of things to do, but there were things. There was a swimming pool and they also had a ladies softball team after a while. I can remember that in the summer, they played different areas, different towns, and after they built roads and got them improved later on it made a difference because people could travel more and do--well, there's not a lot to do in any of the towns, but they could travel back and forth.
CE: Well, thank you very much Gerry. I appreciate all of the information you've given me, and it's been a very enlightening evening.
GS: You're welcome.
