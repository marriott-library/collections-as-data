Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 1

Interviewer: Leslie K~l~.v

MB My name is Marguerite Shepard, S-H-E-P-A-R-D, Browne. With an E. And I was born in Reno, Kansas, February the 12th, no, Feburary

the 5th, 1912.

L

Would you give the names of your parents.

MB Amanda Harvey Amanda, was my mother and my father's name was Albert.

L

What did your parents do for a livelihood?

MB My father was a farmer. My mother never worked.

L

She was a housewife and took care of the family?

MB Yes.

L

What kind of farming did your father do? What kind of a farm was it?

MB Well, it was sort, it just wasn't one thing. He raised potatoes, for

commercial use and he raised corn and things like that. Just regular

farming. But the main thing that he did before, oh, it was World

War II.

L

It had to be World War I.

MB No, it had to be World War II, that he raised potatoes. But World

War I, wasn 1 t that in '18?

L

'18, yeah.

MB Well, then it was World War II, then. But he raised them until the

bottom dropped out of things during the depression. And then he

just raised things, you know, that he could sell. He had a - at

that time - a vegetable stand. And the things that he raised he

sold mostly on that vegetable stand. And then he raised yams. We

called them sweet potatoes. But anyway, he raised yarns for the

winter and he sold them during the winter. That was during the de-

pression, though. And after the depression, why, · he returned to

the same old thing, only the market for the potatoes, the potatoes

that we raised there in Kansas was no longer, you know, the potatoe.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 2

So, he didn't raise them to ship or anything, you know. So he just

raised or farmed it.

L

What kind of a life was it to farm? How was it to live there?

MB Well, we were young and we thought it was great. You see, we thought

living that way was great because we had the advantage of having

being around animals and learning a lot that way and he never re-

stricted us from using - riding horses and things like that. Any-

thing we wanted to do, we were able to do it. So, it wasn't a bad

life at all. I've always wanted to go back to a farm. I love to

hear the chickens in the morning when they got up and I loved to

see my father come in with the horses and the mules and water them

and feed them. It was a great life. I really did like it. And if

I was younger I think I'd go back to it now. 'Cause it certainly

beats city life. Well, not city life but it beats living where you

can't raise anything. Where you can't have anything that you want

to unless you go to the store and buy it. It's worth 10¢ and you

pay 69¢ for it. It certainly beats that. You can have your own

milk and cream. When you want a chicken you just go and knock the

chicken in the head. (laugh) But that was the best part of my

life, I believe, is when I was young and did live there. Of course

we lived in a little town, called Lawrence, Kansas and, of course,

farming - industry wasn't but about a mile away, see, from where we

lived. So we considered ourselves living in the city and still

living on a farm. 'Cause at that time you didn't have anything -

where we lived on the outskirts of the town, well, you could have

anything you wanted. Now you can't have anything, you know, because

we raised hogs and we had cows and horses and things right there at

the edge of the city. You can't do that anymore. 'Cause it's all

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 3

built up around there now. See?

L

But it was a small town? It sounds like.

MB Lawrence, Kansas, you've probably heard of it. Jayhawkers state.

Jayhawkers. Yep. Anyway, he made enough money on that - the work

he was doing, the farming thing. He had seven children and he sent

five of them to college. So, I think he did very well.

L

It sounds like he did. What were some of the difficulties of that

kind of lifestyle?

MB Well, at that time there really wasn't any difficulties. Really,

until the depression. Until the depression of 19--when was it--'29

came along. Well, there wasn't any difficulties.

L

What effect did the depression have on you guys?

MB Oh, the depression just - everything just went to pot because you

couldn't sell anything 'cause no one had any money to buy it with.

So, it was - my dad's ingenuity was what kept us all together.

And the kids weren't working. They couldn't find a job so it was

my dad's responsibility to actually provide for us.

L

What do you mean by his ingenuity? What did he do?

MB Well, uh, he learned how to - it was sort of masonry and these

places that were building stone walls and wells and things like that,

he worked at that. See, h~ was able to do that because they needed

it and he had the no-how. And he taught my brother to do it and so

that's one of the ways that we lived during that depression. And

with the farm - when we didn't have to pay for everything, why,

we, uh, my dad, we used lard at that time. .Nobody knew about crisco

and I have seen him take a bucket on Saturday night. We never went

to the store during the week at all and on Saturday night, my dad

would do the shopping. And he would take this bucket, tin bucket

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 4

and have it fill~d up with lard for 10¢ a pound. See. He didn't

buy it in a pound or so. He'd fill this bucket up with lard and

things like that kept us going.

L

Did your mother hang in there pretty well during the depression?

MB Oh, sure. My mother was from the country and city life didn't mean

anything to her, you know. She'd go to church and come home. And

maybe visit people, her neighbors, but as far as being in society

or something like that, that wasn't her bag. She had children to

raise and my mother - another way that she - she didn't work but

she would take in boarders. They had some kind of work there in

Lawrence and some of her relatives would come from out of town, why

she would take them in and they would pay her. And I've seen her

with a tub and board, washboard and doing their washing and feeding

them. Get up every morning and put their lunches up and have their

dinner on the table when they got home. They liked that. And she

had all these children. So you see, she was really a helpmate. She

didn't have anything to do with the farming. She always had her

garden but she never did have to go to what we called the fields and

help, you know with that. But she always had her garden. She would

just have died if she didn't have her chickens and her garden. So, my
. that was/life as a youngster. Of course, I boarded part of it. I
got married. 'Cause I got married when I was eighteen.

And no job, no nothing. We borrowed the money to get married on

and, uh, then he came to Utah to help his mother and so we eloped.

And I was there three months after he came out here and to be frank

with you, I don't even remember what he looked like, after three

months. (laugh) I always said if I could just have waited, and

went onto school like I was supposed to. But then we came to Utah

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 5

during the depression and that was hard. That was hard because

his mother lived on a farm too down between Price and Helper in

a little, you know, you've heard of that. And we had a farm down

there right next to the country club. And that was a hard life.

That was.

L

What was the country club called?

MB

It was just called - all I remember is a country club. But we

never, uh, well, that was a hard life then because it just wasn't

any money anywhere, you know. You couldn't buy a job and it was

good that we did have the farm because the commodities that they

were giving, why, it was mostly - I don't know - I always, after I

grew up and thought about it, I just think it was rejects that we

were getting, you know. Old canned meat and flour and stuff like

that. It was just something that they could give away. And then

you know, that was the time that all this P.W.A. and W.P.A. was

set up, you know. And you'd have to almost crawl on your knees to

get it, anyth~ng. They had clothing and like that. You'd almost

have to crawl on your knees and they discriminated too. Now, my

father in law, uh, he went to get his rations or whatever it was

and ended up in jail because they were giving people things and

wouldn't give them to him ~nd he got angry and just popped the guy.

So, he ended up in jail. So that was how the depression was with

us. But, we were fortunate that we could live with his mother and

stepfather. And we still didn't think it was that hard. We really

didn't think it was that hard. Because, as far as the money was

concerned, there wasn't anything to spend money for. You didn't

need to buy any clothes. You had clothes and there wasn't any need

to buy them. You weren't going anywhere. You didn't have any money

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 6

to_go anywhere. Even if the movies were 10¢ and steak was 15¢.

See, you didn't have the money to buy it. You were happy - these

suckers that I see, that they're selling now for 25¢ apiece. They

were 1¢ and, of course, we were happy to get a sucker and suck it

all day.

L

How did that area down there strike you? Did you like it down

there? What did you think of it?

MB I liked the outdooors part of it. But, see, I came from Lawrence,

right out of Kansas City and it was strange not to have anyplace to

go or anything to do, you know. And with the Black people, why,

there were just a handful of them and they were all older people.

See, when I came down there - see that was a mining town all around.

And that's where they worked, in the mines. And it wasn't nothing

that you would want to be in for any length of time. But when you're

married and you have to go where your husband goes and that was where

his mother was and where she needed him. So that's why we stayed

there and he worked in the mines in the winter and in the summer he

didn't. But we still didn't mind that so much because I loved the

outdoors anyway. I guess you can get that from what I've already

told you. But I loved the mountains and we'd get the horses and

we'd ride and climb the mountains and things like that. There

wasn't very much to do because we didn't have much to do in. That's

a woman. Much to do in because if we had wanted a house we couldn't

have found one because no one would rent one. Not even a hole in

the ground would they rent it to you. So you lived the best you

could. When my second child was born, uh, we lived in a chicken

coop because no one would rent us a house. So we lived in a chicken

coop and we had more mice than we did anything else around.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 7

Naturally. And then after that we rented another chicken coop.

L

What did a chicken coop - how big is a chicken coop?

MB Oh, I guess the whole thing that we lived in - there was two -

supposed to be - there was two parts to that. And I don't imagine

that thing was as large as about half of this room here.

L

Half of this? Or the whole room?

MB Well, the whole room. Half of the room.

L

Half the living room.

MB It wasn't any larger - no, we did have two in the second one so it

was as large as this living room, the complete living room. ·cause

we had a kitchen and a bedroom, yeah. And then my husband is very

good at carpenter work and so then we moved down to carbonvtl1e.

We were living in Helper at that time and we moved down to Carbon-

villeon the farm. His mother's farm. And he built a three-room

house. In thinking of it now I wouldn't even call it a house. It

was just, I don't know, 'cause the rooms were so small but he built

it out of ties, railroad ties. Built our home out of railroad ties.

You know what railroad ties are?

L

Yeah.

MB Those - they're about that wide, you know and that thick too. So,

and then we never did get it stuccoed. We were going to stucco it.

But we never did get it before we moved but we had - on the inside

we did have it plastered and everything. And it would get so hot

in there in the wintertime, we just - from the kitchen stove - that

you couldn't hardly live in it. It was so, you know, insulated,

that ties.

L

From the wood. That's something.

MB And then he built his mother a huge home on part of the place and

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 8

it was, I don't know how many rooms was in that. And it was made

out of ties. It was made out of ties. I never will forget putting

the lathes on the walls ' cause you had a certain way you had to

put them, you know. He'd sit up in the night putting those lathes

on so they could be plastered. So, you see, what progress has

done for man. All he has to do is throw a sheet of plasterboard up

there. So, we lived there until 1939 and then we come up here to

live 'cause he was hired a job in the summertime up here on the

railroad. He didn't have a regular job and at that time we had

three kids. So he was working in the summer and not in the winter.

L

Let me ask you before you talk about coming up here. You spoke

just briefly about the discrimination down there. How did you come

up against it? I mean, how did it affect you? How did it touch you?

MB Uh, now I was speaking of discrimination in some areas. You know,

like that, I forget now what they called it. Well, it's just another

form of welfare.

L

The Work's Progress Administration? W.P.A.?

MB The people that worked for them, you know. Now, they would do some

discriminating but as far as other discrimination I didn't come in

contact with it that much. People were very nice. And I didn't

think anything about going to people's homes, you know. And they

coming to mine. So, I really didn't - discrimination there - it

didn't bother me 'cause we went in where we wanted to go. There

wasn't many places you'd want to go. Because most of the things

there was pool halls. That was in Bracken Lee's time.

L

It was mostly pool halls?

MB Uh-huh.

L

What do you remember - I mean, before you went to Carbonv.ille, you

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 9

lived in Helper. Did you live outside of Helper?

MB No, I didn't live in Helper. No, - that was after - when we were

trying to find a place to live, we was trying to find a place in

Helper but no go. So, we never did live really in Helper. We

lived in Carbonville.

L

What was Carbonville like?

MB There wasn't anything. It was just a name, really. Between the

two cities, Price and Helper.

L

There was nothing.

MB There was nothing. A filling station and a little old - and the

filling station had a grocery store in it. It had the grocery store.

So, really Carbonville wasn't anything. The only thing I think that

made it famous was the country club being there.

L

But where were the homes? Where did people live?

MB Oh, all around. Most of them was farmers, out in that area. They

lived all around there but it's just like you know you traveled and

went through a little town and you was through it before you knew it.

And the houses were scattered here and there, well, that's what

Carbonville was.

L

Did you walk around there much? Did you do much walking I assume?

MB Uh, we did a lot of walking. We did a lot of riding around there.

That was, in fact, that was our fun, riding and then we'd get to-

gether with the neighbors and we'd go on the holidays, we'd go to

another little place up in the mountains or something and have a

picnic and stay all night and come back. We had a great time. It

was probably a lot healthier than what we're doing now.

L

Now, I remember vaguely that you worked in that country club for

awhile. Did you?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 10

MB Yes.

L

How did you ...

MB Until it burned down.

L

... how did you get that job?

MB There was - the woman that ran it - she was French and she just

needed some help and she came down - 'cause we lived about a half

block and she came and asked me would I help her? And I was glad

to. What was I getting, 25¢ an hour? Something like that. That

was big money. So I worked there ; when she had large dinners, you

know, and things like that and then I'd go on Sundays, I think it

was, we had to do that. And she and her niece and I would then

clean up the big hall so they could go the next week. And, you

know, I often think about that because you know we cleaned that big

hardwood floor with kerosene and I imagine that when that thing

caught on fire it just went up like, you know. zzzz.

L

With all that keroseneseeped into it.

MB Uh-huh, yeah. 'Cause I didn't even hear what was going on. I woke

up the next morning and looked up there and there wasn't any country

club.

L

It burned up overnight?

MB Uh-huh. Oh, I bet you that thing burned up so fast that half the

people in the neighborhood didn't know 'cause this is at night, you

know. It was only half a block away and didn't even hear it. Fire

Department, if there was one. 'Cause they didn't come out that far

from the city.

L

What happened to it, the country club? How did it burn?

MB It just burned down.

L

Did anybody know how?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 11

MB

No. No.

·

L

And that's where you met - was it the husband of that woman - that

told you that story? About the man who was lynched?

·MB Yes.

L

It was her husband?

MB It was her husband, yeah.

L

Could you tell me how that came about? How did he tell you that

story?

MB I have to tell you, it's been so long ago that I don't remember how

come him to tell me about it. See? But it was probably was in a

conversation and it came up, that's all. Maybe we were talking

about something like that 'cause those things were happening in the

south, you know. And maybe we just got to talking about it. And

he just told me about that.

L

Where did he tell you about it? In the country club?

MB Uh-huh. But I don't remember, you know, anybody ever even, uh,

talking about lynching, you know. Like if you were down south, why,

you wouldn't do that or something like that. 'Cause, you know, a

lot of people would throw that up at you. In a minute, here in

Salt Lake.

L

Like what?

MB Like if you, if you did something that they didn't like, if you was

down south, well, you wouldn't do that. See? In other words, tell-

ing me that I'd either get put in jail or get beat up or lynched

or something. If I did what I did here down there.

L

They were telling you to watch your step?

MB Uh-huh. See, just like - now I thought this couple was the best

friends I had. They were white. I thought they were the best

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 12
friends I had and they had a few chickens and they was some kids that kept going in there in the chicken house they called it and gettings the eggs. So one evening they caught them and one of the little boys was a little Black boy and he said something smart to the man and the man was telling me about it. And he said, "Now if he'd been down south, he wouldn't have did that." And I was very angry and I asked him what he meant by that if he was down south he wouldn't do that. I said, "He was a child, wasn't he?" I said, "Children are liable to do anything like that. And I thought you was a friend of mine but you look at me as being Black and different from you and that I shouldn't do those things because of my color. Now, I supposed to let you get away with murder towards me. Because of my color." Now, of course, I never did go for that for the simple reason that I was born in a small community, like I told you and we were - there was Blacks and white. We all lived there around there together. And we were frien9s. In fact, there was one family that called my father dad and if anything ever happened in their family, they would always call my father to be the gobetween. Their family. See, that's the way we lived around in that community. I went to segregated schools through the sixth grade and then went to integrated schools from then on. So you see, I have been used to being around whites all my life. Now Howard wasn't. But I was. So, they didn't intimidate me. Now, but when I was young in Lawrence, it didn't bother me 'cause I was young. I had my own group to run around with and go places so if you didn't want me at your place, I don't want to come to your place, see? 'Cause I have my own to run around with. Now, if something like that had happened in Carbonville or Price, it would have upset me at that

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 13
because I was young and I really didn't understand or fully comprehend what was discrimination andseg~egation was all about until I really came up here to Salt Lake City. Then's when it really hit me what they were talking about, discrimination and segregation. Because I had grown up - I was married and I realized what it really meant. And I never really - it didn't bother me until I moved to Salt Lake. Until we moved to Salt Lake. And then it hit you right

I really

in every way. Every way. The only job that I

could get would be as a maid, you know. Get a maid's job was about

it ; No matter what kind of education you had, that was it. The

railroad and the hotels is what brought the Black man in to Salt Lake

City. Of course, I know you've been told that before. But that's

what brought them in here. And that's all they were looking for.

Was jobs at the hotel and jobs at the railroad because they knew

their wives would probably get a.job as a maid or a live-in, you

know. But that wasn't just here in Salt Lake. That was all over

the country. So, except teaching jobs, you know, back in the east

and the south, why, you could get a job as a teacher and if you

went on maybe, the professions were open to you too and they were -

see now, you get to be a doctor or a lawyer or something like that,

you knew you were going to make it because the white doctors just

didn't want to be bothered.

L

They wouldn't accept you?

MB Uh-ugh. No, right here in Salt Lake there was doctors that had a

separate office down in the slums, down on 2nd South there. He had

an office down there. He was a dentist. He was a dentist. His

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 14

white clients he catered to up town, the Blacks down there. And

it was, uhhh. I went one time and no more. I couldn't stand the

smell even. But I had a dentist that I went to. His office was

in a house, in the back of the house and I didn't think anything

about it. I just took my daughter on over there. And he worked

on her. So, somebody told me that they went to him and he wouldn't

do the work. So, I called him and asked him and he said, "No."

And he would prefer if I would find me another dentist.

L

You must have been taken aback.

MB Well, you know, you have to call if you wanted any work done on

your or doctor that you could trust, you know, or anything, you'd

have to call them first and find out whether they would take you.

So, during that time and I was so glad when the civil rights move-

ment came. After 1963 they couldn't do that. Whether they wanted

you or not, they had to take you. So, that helped. And imagine

what's it like to go up town and, you know, how women are when they're

shopping, they love to sit down and eat lunch, you know. That's an

out for them. Well, you can imagine how embarrassing it is to have

to go ask, will they serve you. To keep from being embarrassed be-

fore all the people in there, I invariably would go ask them, "Would

you serve me in here?"

L

You'd ask them?

MB

Uh-huh.

L

Would it take a lot to ask?

MB

It's humiliating, degrading to think that the establishment won't

even take your money 'cause you know you're going to have to pay for

it. But they didn't even want your money.

L

What was the answer most of the time?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 15

MB No. There was several places that we know, we knew we could go,

so we went there instead of going like to Walgreen's, one of the

Walgreen's Drugstores and Kress's and then there was another place

that I went in and asked and, ooh, that man got so angry at me hav-

ing to ask him, could I eat in there. He was downright angry. To

think that I had to ask him about it. 'Cause he said, "I serve

anybody. That's what I got the place open for." And he asked me

if this was a common occurrence. Well, I told him yes. I'd rather

be embarrassed just in front of me to my face than to let everybody

else know it. But that went on for years and years. Until after

the civil rights, in 1963. After 1963. I told you about us, I

think, about us being tax payers and everything and would go in the

City and County Building down there and they had it right as you

come in the door, a lunch counter and they wouldn't let us sit down

there. We wanted a cup of coffe. We got it in a paper cup and drank

it standing up by the wall or something.

L

Rather than a regular cup?

MB Uh-huh. Yeah, , but they had a paper insert.

L

That was just the Blacks?

MB Un-huh.

L

How do you take that all tbe time?

MB There wasn't anything we could do about it. We had no laws behind

us, you know. We had nothing we could do about it, except take it.

L

Does it break you down inside?

MB No, it didn't break me down inside me because you see, I have quite

a great faith in God and I just knew that someday, just like the

song we sing, "We Shall Overcome Someday". And we were working

towards that goal and I just felt that in my time too that I would

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 16

see this thing go down. This discrimination and segregation wo~Id

go down. When I wouldn't have to walk in a movie and take a chain

down in order to get to the place where I sit, could sit. I've

been asked out of the theater many a time 'cause I didn't sit where

they wanted me to sit.

L

Were you involved in some of the work that was going on here in town?

MB You mean ...

L

The NAACP? For instance?

MB No, not the NAACP but I wasn't able to really get out and do the

marching and things like that with them. But I supported them in

any way I could other than that. Any petitions come around or tak-

ing out petitions or something like that, why, and I attended the

different meetings that they would have to let us know what was

going on, you know. I attended those. I did work with the NAACP

awhile but it got to the place where I couldn't so I had to leave

that. But I tell you what I would do. Anytime there was an open-

ing in some white organization, you know, and I could get in, I

would get in. So that I could have my input in it and let them know

how I felt and see how many felt the same thing with me. And let

them know what was really going on. Because, do you realize there

was articles come out in the paper that there was no segregation and

discrimination in Salt Lake. In the worst place in the whole United

States. We had a map and it showed the worst place and · it was Salt

Lake City, Utah. It was Utah. Was the most segreated, discriminating

place in the United States.

L

What map was this?

MB Well, it was a map that was drawn by, I think, by one of the groups

that's in the movement, you know. But it was printed in our paper.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 1, p 17

L

What organizations did you get to join?

MB Oh, let's see now, what did I belong to. I belonged - I got in the

it wasn't comprehensive health, but it was to do with health. The

government. It was Governor Rampton, I think, it was, appointed me

to this board and when I got in there and then they put me on the

review board. Do you know what the review board is? That is where

every nursing home, every hospital and anything that had to do with

health with the public, had to come through that board and we could

either reject them having the hospital or we could reject them having

the nursing home or we could tell them what they had to do before

they set them up and everything. Well, now that way, I could put a

lot of input in there because of the things that they were doing to

the Black person in these institutions.

L

Go ahead. What did you know about them?

MB Well, do you know when I first came up here, that we couldn't go to

the hospital. They wouldn't even - we had - they would give us a

private room. If we wanted a - what do you call it?

Side 2

MB We couldn't go in the ward . because the white man objected to a Black

man being in the same room with his wife and they would, regardless

of what it costs, you had to pay for a private room.

L

To get hospital care?

MB To get hospital care. Regardless.

L

Did this happen to you, personally?

MB No. It was good that I didn't have to go to the hospital at that

time. But that's what was happening here in Salt Lake City before

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 18

the civil rights, before 1963. And one Black guy, he was a lawyer

and he told them when he went in there. He put his sister in there

that he wanted her in a ward. Well, when she got ready to leave,

why, they were charging him for a private room and he wouldn't pay

and he took it to court. He was a lawyer.

L

Was that David Oliver?

MB Yeah, and he took it to court. And he won it but nevertheless it

didn't change anything. They still did it. Because there was too

many that didn't, you know, question it because they knew when they

went there what it was going to be.

L

Do you know what hospital that was?

MB All of them. But this one especially, L.D.S.

L

The L.D.S. Was that the hospital he sued?

MB Uh-huh. I don't know. And as far as me with my jobs, it was very,

very funny. I would go to work as a maid and these people were just

ordinary people, you know. He was a professor, I think, at the

University. But that was the last job I had as a maid and I would

be mopping her floors and crying to think that I had to mop floors

and I bet I had a better education than she did. And finally, I got

a job at the hospital, the old General Hospital down here in the
. laundry. And I was supposed to be the laundry clerk and so, that is

passing out the laundry to different departments, you know, when

they came in to pick it up and the boss, the man I'll say was the

boss. But anyway, someway I knew he didn't want me in there. I

knew he didn't want me in there so he just kept picking at me and

picking at me and one day he came through the room where I was and

he started in how these lie. He was going around and I'm going to

do this and I'm going to do that. Well, I didn't pay any attention

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 19

to him because I didn't know what he was talking about. And finally

it dawned on me. It hit me just like a brick. Marguerite, he's

talking about you. So, he started out the door and I went over to

him. I caught him by the shoulder and turned him around. See, that's

the kind of a person I am. (laugh) And I said, "Mr. Larsen, are

you talking about me or to me?" He said, "I'm talking about whoever

told so and so this and that and carrying tales." I said, "Did you

tell me that?" "No, I didn't tell you." I said, "Was I anywhere

near you when you said it?" "No, you wasn't." I said, "Then you

are talking to me and you don't have the facts. Now, whoever you

said that in front of is the one to be talking to 'cause you didn't

tell me that. 11 And I said, 11 And another thing, I'm a woman. I

don't care what color I am, I'm a woman and you're a man. Now, if

you want to talk to me, then talk to me on those grounds. Don't

you ever do anything like that to me again." Me comfronting him

like that just changed him like that. And before I left there,

before I got let out of there, I - he would go away on his vacations

and leave me in charge of that place 'cause anything he asked me to

do I had it up here enough to - that he could trust me to do run

that place.

L

What was he complaining ab? ut? I still don't understand.

MB

I don't remember what it was. Somebody told something, said some-

thing about what was going on in the laundry, see. Or something.

But I wasn't even there and knew anything about it. At first, I

couldn't even understand what he was talking about because - but

eventually it hit me like I said. He was talking to me about me.

See? And he was going to fire me and everything and I said, "This

man's talking about me." Talking to me really in a backhanded way.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 20

But I got him straightened out. I had to get several of them

straightened to hold that job. I really did. Then I went from

there, when I got let out of there, you know, it was on the poli-

tical patronage and if the Republicans were there, why the Demo-

crats came in, Oh, the Democrats went out. Regardless. And so,

we knew we were going when the Republicans came in, we knew we

were going. So I just went on over and got a job as a maid in a

nursing home. And that woman. I don't think she'd ever held a

job before with any authority. And she just tried to overpower

everybody. And she told something on me one day that made me so

angry that I didn't wait. I met her at the door, at her door, her

office door and we went round and round. And I told her if she

ever did that to me again a menial, and you a job as supervisor

and you did that to me as a menial. I said, "I'll be a menial

'cause I'll knock your teeth down your throat. That settled that.

I wanted a leave of absence and she wouldn't give it to me.

L

She wouldn't?

MB No. I couldn't have it. She wouldn't give it to me.

That's a good way of getting rid of me. As I say, when I went to

the laundry, it was sort of a step up.

L

What year was that?

MB That was, uh, in the fifties. But I can't remember just exactly

when. But then I went from there - where did I go to? Oh, I went

down to the Ci~y and County Building as a janitress. And I worked

there - it was on split shift. We had to go in the morning and in

the evening. I worked there. But there was a man that I cleaned

his office and his name was David Jones. But anyway, he got to the

place where he saw that, you know ... The funny thing about it is why

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 21
people think all Black people and especially at that time, all Black people were alike. See? They were all alike. They were all stupid. And wasn't capable of doing anything but stupid work. But anyway, we'd have conversations and he found out that I did have a little something up there that I'd reached at least eight cylinders or six. Anyway. So, we'd have big conversations after everybody was gone. We'd get in there and just discuss things. Everything. So, he grew to like me and I thought he was the greatest person in the world. So he came up for reelection. He was the County Auditor. Well, I got out at that time and I walked the streets from North Temple to Liberty Park and all up on the avenues, all up on the east side and everything, putting out literature. West side and everything. I worked really hard. So, he got elected. And we were standing in there. I was doing my janitor work and I said to him, "Mr. Jones, I know you're going to put everybody to work that worked for you. Now, you know there wasn't anyone in here that worked any harder than I did. How about giving me a job?" He turned just as red as a beet. And walked back in his office. And I said, "Now I'm going to see which way the ball's going to roll." So he came back out. He said, "Can you type, Marguerite? I said, "Yes, after a fashion." I hadn't typed since I left high school. So he said, "Well, come to the office in the morning. And you set your time." Because I was still doing janitor's work. So I said, "Well, I'd have to go home and get myself ready. I wouldn't dare come to the office, you know, after doing janitor work." He said, "You set your own hours." And so I did. And do you know I worked in that office typing and so one day he came to me and says, "Marguerite, what do you want to learn in this office? ' Because I was working there almost full time. They had that much to

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 22

I

I

do. And he said, "What would you like to do in this office?" I

said, "Everything that I can." When I ended up I had the top job

in that office. Then the Republicans came in and I didn't last a

half a minute. But to show you what women are talking about now.

The man that held that job was making at that time six hundred and

some dollars a month. Well, when I took the job and it had gotten

larger than it was when he had it, 'cause I had to audit every bill

that came in from every department in the county and recommend that

they be paid. But anyway, he was getting six hundred and something,

I was $480. That was it. So, anyway ···

L

What years were those?

MB That was during 1966, I think it was. Anyway, there was a woman

going to quit and I went to Mr. Jones and I said, "How about giving

me her job and putting me on regular?" This was before I got this

other job. But he said - he never said anything to me but he went

to his chief deputy and he told him, he said, "I'm going to give

Marguerite Vi's job." He hit the ceiling. "No, you're not. Now,

you're not. We can't have her sitting up in here all day as a

regular employee." And he listened to him. But there was one of

the guys in there that was a good friend of mine and he told me about

it. He told me about it. And the ironic part about it it was the

guy that didn't want me sitting up in there was Italian. And he's

had his troubles just like anybody - I've had, you know. When he

come to America. But I didn't get the job. But at last, Mr. Jones

just didn't pay any attention to him and he went on and the next

opening that came along and give me the job. But when the Republi-

cans came in, why, his name was Palmer, but he couldn't stand it.

L

Palmer?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 23

MB He couldn't stand it. And they computerized things. Now, I knew

darn good and well that computerizing my job was going to be some

deal. Was really going to be some deal. I didn't see how in the

world they could do it. Anyway, he let me go. And he owed me

three hundred and some odd dollars when I quit. Do you know that I

had to take him before the Commissioners and the Commissioners said,

"Pay her." They called my former employer, Mr. Jones. They called

him and said, "You owe her so many days vacation and this, that and

the other." And do you know that man never did pay me. I hired a

lawyer and the lawyer, he fooled around and messed around and fooled

around till one of those Commissioners gave me a job. (laugh) In

the county licensing department. And I'll be doggoned if the Rep-

ublicans didn't come in again and framed me and got me out of there.

He was a Bircher. And he couldn't stand it.

L

The guy who came in?

MB Un-huh.

L

What was his name?

MB Oh, I can't think of his name now. It was right on the tip of my

tongue but I can't think of it right now. But anyway, he framed me.

L

What did he do?

MB The dogcatchers came in that evening and brought their money. No.

They came in that morning, it was, and brought $27 in there. We had

no cash register. The only thing we could do with the money was

just leave it here or put it in a drawer or something until evening

and we'd put it in the safe.So anyway, I put the money under my

blotter on my desk and went for my break. We had a fifteen minute

break so I went. At that time they had hired a little girl. She

set right in front of me and they were hiring welfare workers in the

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 24

office and so the next morning, when I went to do my license - I

was over to the dog license to do the license, I had to have the

names of the people and things and I got back and lo and behold,

the $27 was gone. I knew someone in the office had to do it. I

knew that. So, I went to the guy that was over us there. He was

a young fellow and I said to him, "Don't say anything about it''- 'cause

I knew this guy was a Bircher - Birrell - his last name was Birrell.

So I said, "Don't say anything to him 'cause he's after me. And

you know he's after me." So instead of that, he went and told him.

The next morning here he was. "Well, Marguerite, I hear you're

short $27." I said, "Yes, I am and I don't know where it could have

gone." And he humiliated by having one of the girls in the office

come over and search my desk. And we went through it. And I had a

shoe box there with all the licenses that had been voided, you know,

because you had to keep track of every license. Every license was

numbered and you had to keep track of it. They were in this shoe

box. And I just took the shoe box and dumped it up like that and

there was that $27 underneath those dog licenses. And I said, "Now,

somebody in here had to do that." The next day I got fired because

of making that statement, creating an atmosphere of distrust in the

office.

L

That's the reason they gave?

MB The reason he did. And I got fired. So, then I went on out to, uh,

they kept begging me and begging me to come to the airport and write

insurance and I didn't want to go because at that time I was 58 years

old and I said, "No, I'm too old to be applying for your type of a

job." But the orders had come down to hire Blacks. So, I said, "I

don't want to apply for that job. I just don't" - well, the guy

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 25

that asked me, he said, "Marguerite, you're the only one that I

know that I could suggest to do the job." I said, "Alright, I'll

go apply." Well, I went out and applied for it and got up and

went on to California. (laugh) And they waited for me to come back

'cause I had the job. So I went out there on probation, you know.

And this woman that was supposed to be the head, she was supposed

to be there at 6:00. Now, I'm new on the job and I'm never to be

left alone on my probation. I was there two days and everyone of

them got up and walked out of the office, out of the desk and went

to a funeral and left me there on my own to write insurance policies.

So, I did it. I didn't complain. But I learned the job. And I was

selling more insurance than they were because I treated the people

a whole lot differently than they were.

L

You mean you became an insurance salesman? An insurance salesman?

MB For Mutual of Omaha. So I worked there and she was supposed to come

in there at 6:00. She'd come in at 8:00 and from 6:00 through that

time is the busiest time at the airport because the planes, you

know, were coming in that time of the morning.

L

You were selling airplane insurance?

MB Uh-huh. And people at the counters was lined up and all I could do

was throw sheets, you know . and then just try to tell them what this

was and try to sell what they called annual insurance and everything.

And here she'd come lazing in about 8:00. I knew she was after me.

See? And so, anyway, it came down just before the time was up for

me to get the job and she's going to give me a test. Do you know

that woman stood over me like Simon Legree. She didn't give me the

benefit of a doubt of a - you know, if I was writing $10,000, putting

that comma in there on the $10,000, you know.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 26

L

If you didn't have that comma in there, she'd mark it wrong?

MB Mark it wrong. And, uh, I would ask them, "How do you write a

$100,000 insurance and this one girl - she was in with her - you

write it on this, you write it on that and you write it on that.

Three different insurance companies you had to write it on. See?

Didn't ever show me how to write one or anything, see. Didn't tell

me how to, to write up an annual policies and things. And before

I left there, when I got fired, the very, day I got fired, I wrote

the only $240,000 insurance policy that had ever been written there.

People would be - she couldn't stand it, because people were corning

back in the evening out there to thank me for something I'd done

for them. To thank me for telling them something. That was going

to be against them, you know.

L

You saved them from an error?

MB Yeah, I run clear across the airport out there getting to people

that hadn't signed this or they hadn't done that or something, you

know. And they would come back and thank me for it. She couldn't

stand it. And you see, I knew all the politicians. I'd worked at

the City and County Building. I knew all those politicians from

the Senator on down and they would come over there to the counter

and, you know, "Oh, Marguerite, I'm so happy to see you here." It

was just great. Shoot! When she gave me that test well, I didn't

take that one sitting down. I wrote to the company and they sent a

man out here. He took us to lunch and we sat there and talked about

it and she threw this annual policy, "Look what she did. She didn't

do so and so." And I said, "In that drawer where· you got this, did

you see Lois's in there? She's been here eleven years." I said,

"Lois's was in there too, why didn't you bring hers?" They brought

mine up there and I hadn't been there three rnopths. See? I had

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 27

failed to mark something on that annual. And so anyway, ~She did

this and she's not .suitable for this type of job." I looked at the

man. I said, "Did you look at my sales' record?" He said, "I

certainly did and it's tremendous." He threw her letter over to

her. He said, "I recommend that you rehire Marguerite." That's

just the way she done. "I have made my choice." There I went again.

I was so mad. If I'd had had a tommy gun I think I'd just have

walked down the street and mowed people down. Everytime I'd get up

to the top of something, down I'd go.

L

Knock you right back down.

MB Right back down again. I got to the place where I didn't even want

to go apply for a job. I didn't want a job out in the white man's

world. I just didn't want it. To go through that again. So anyway,

so finally the federal government was putting out programs, you know?

And I got in on a - I knew I was being hired as a token but anyway,

I got the job with Model Cities. It was in my area. Model Cities

was in the area where I lived in.

L

What was that area?

MB On the west side.

L ·That was the other house you had?

MB Uh-huh.

L

Where was that?

MB On 3rd South and 12th West. But it was in that area and so I applied

for the job and I got it and I was supposed to be - and guess what -

they didn't even have a title for me. Special Assistant to the

Director. I said, "You're another flunkie. They don't intend to

teach you anything. You're just another flunkie, drawing federal

government wages." So, it finally came up - they needed evaluators.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 28

Something was coming up. The government - HUD - wanted something.

And they had to get this done. So they were sending everybody down

there - in the evaluator department to help. So I went down there

too. I went to this little guy. He was from - I don't know - he's

a Chicano. But anyway, I went to him and talked to him about it.

I said, "Hey, I want that job." He said, "Okay, we' 11 do it to-

gether then." And he put me with him. You know. That was another

discrimination because why didn't they put me with, with the girl

that was over the whole department. Let her teach me. "No, I was

with him. Well, I'll teach you." And we went on and I had to write

up the evaluation that went to HUD. And the department said, "I had

to evaluate it." Anyway, he wrote a letter to the director and told

him that I was capable of doing interviews on my own.

L

What was your job?

MB You see - in the Model Cities, they had different projects, see. And

each project you had to go and find out what they do and how they do

it and everything like that. And then write it up. Whether to rec-

ommend that they be funded or defunded. You see?

L

Write it up for HUD?

MB For HUD?

L

So HUD hired you to overlook ·..

MB HUD didn't hire me, Model Cities did it.

L

Oh, Model Cities did it.

MB The director of Model Cities.

L

And you went from program to program?

MB Yeah. I had so many of my own. I had so many meetings that I had to

make every week with this project or that project. They met at night.

And anyway, I said ...

(pause)

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 29
MB So, the director - I was at one of these meetings and I said to him, "I'd like to have that job as an evaluator." He looked at me and said, "Why, Marguerite, no way." I had kind of smiled when I asked him about it, 'cause I was kind of kidding. But when he laughed, I got angry. I went back to director. I didn't ··· at that time, I didn't care whether I got fired or not because I'd been fired before and one way or the other I knew it was coming, see. So I said to him, "Why did you laugh? What was so funny about that?" He said, "Why, Marguerite, you couldn't do that job. You this and you that. You'd have to have this and you'd have to have that." I said, "Nobody else has got it in the evaluation department. Nobody else has got it." So anyway, he said, "Well, I couldn't give you that job." So I went on and I went to my supervisor and I said to her, "I'd like to have that job, Shauna." She said, "Why, Marguerite you'd have to have a"- gosh I forget that kind of degree. Whatever it was. And I said, "Well, why, Horhays is sitting in there with a Master's Degree, does he have it? You've got a Master's Degree, do you have it?" "No." "Bill's setting in there with a Phd. Does he
have it?" "No." "Then when you get down to me, why do I have to have it?" "Well, I would be programming you to fail if I gav.e you that job." Now that's what she . said to me. I said, "Oh, you're going to be my judge and my jury without a trial. I'm not taking it." I said, "HUD told you when you hired Model Cities employees from Model Cities, and they weren't qualified, then qualify them." I said, "Now, you're going to go to the University . Now you're telling me that you know what I need. You're going to the University and find the subjects that I need and enroll me. See that I get in it." "Oh, okay, Marguerite." I said, "Now, I'm going to sit on this job

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 30

for the six months it takes at this salary. But I'm doing what I'm

doing now. I'm not going to write up evaluations for HUD. I'm not

going to bring back reports and things to this office. I'm going to

learn." I said, "When I get qualified, I want to move. Do you

understand, Shauna?" "Yes, oh, yes. I understand." I said, "Now

I've been doublecrossed so many times." I said, "Now you can double-

cross me if you want to. This job don't mean that much to me,

because I can go home and sit down." I said, "But if you double-

cross, I'm going to knock you on your------. " "Oh, Marguerite,

oh, no, no." I said, "Well, look for it, it's coming."So, it went

on and, uh, I went on my vacation and when I came back we had also

help the planning department. And write up these sort of forms -

project things. The projects had to fill them out and return them.

So we'd know the progress they were making.

L

Progress reports?

MB Yeah. So anyway, status reports, they were. So we did that. And

so I wrote up mine and put the thing in my drawer, . ~~e of the desk

drawers and went on my vacation. When I come back, this girl, she

was the supervisor over the planning department, she said, "Congrat-

ulations, Marguerite." I said, "For what?" She said, "Do you know

your plan, your status rep9rt was the only one we could use. And

that was with Phds, Master's and everything, yours was the only one

we could use." I said, "Well, thanks." So then I did decide to

fight for this job. And so I went to the director again and he

said - finally he come down, he called me. And in the office every-

one was congratulating me, see again. What it was all about. And

so I went to him to find out what the congratulations was about.

And he said, "Well, we've decided to give you this job as an evalua-

tor. I said, "Oh, what's my salary going to be?" Well, we're going

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 31

to get you as much as we can." I said, "What do you mean, as much

as you can. I've been around this City and County Building for

going on ten, eleven years. Now what do you mean? As much as you

can?" "Well, what do you mean, as much as you can?" I said, "I

didn't make the statement, you did. I don't have to explain to

you. You explain to me what you're talking about." I said, "If

you're talking about $498, forget it." I said, "I'm not going to

do the same thing that the other people are doing down there for

that and they're getting at that time it was $700 and something.

I'm not going to do it." Well, he got angry. "Well, I'll see what

I can do." Well, when he come back from the Commissioners - they

had to take everything to the Commissioner - he come back from the

Commissioner, I had the job.

L

And?

MB - And Salary. And I didn't go to school. But they just didn't want

me to have that job. Even the director, he just, he just wasn't

going for it at all.

L

Who was the director at that time? Was it Flores?

MB No. Pete Grundfossen.

L

Who?

MB Pete Grundfossen.

L

How do you spell that?

MB G-R-U-N-D-F~O-S~S-E-N. He's with the attorney's office, the County

Attorney's. For awhile. And he went back to law school and got his

degree. He and this Shauna, that I was telling you about. Both of

them went to law school, back to law school. Well, she's got her

job. She works for the county health, you know. Over the aged.

L

Is that Shauna O'Neil?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 32

MB Uh-huh. Shauna O'Neil.

MB

L

I've met her. /After I told her what I was going to do to her, we

got to be very good friends. But anyway, this Pete Grundfossen just

didn't think - uh-ugh, you can't have that job. So they decided to

try me and they sent me up to this center. You know that center on

3rd East, Central City?

L

Yes.

MB They sent me up there to evaluate that. Well, I saw what a mess

was going on up there. It was ridiculous. And I put it down on

paper. This was part of Pete Grundfossen's work too. So I took it

to Shauna, my supervisor and let her read it. Well, when it came

back, it didn't mean a thing. It didn't mean anything. So I took

it into this other girl, supervisor of planning and I said, "Read

this." And she read it. And I said, "Now, read mine." She read

mine. She said, "Why, Shauna hasn't said anything, she just took

out the parts that really meant something." So she went down there

and she told Shauna. She said, "Shauna, you can't do this. You

just can't do it." So, Shauna said, "Well, let her write it her way

then." And I turned it in. First I took it into Pete to see what

he thought about it. Well, he'd throw a question at me and I'd

answer his question, you kBow. And he didn't disturb me at all.

With the questions he was asking. So, they let it go through, but

Shauna came up to me. She said, "Marguerite, I never will audit

one of your evaluations anymore." I said, "Thank you."

L

She never will what?

MB Audit anymore of my evaluations. And when Model Cities was getting

ready to disband, you know, it was supposed to go for five years

but they had to phase it out in less time. So anyway, Pete called

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 33

me in his office and told me, at least he was honest with me. He

said, "Marguerite, I just want to Lell you what a great job you

did for Model Cities." But I wasn't qualified for it. Shauna,

she's programming IDE, to fail. And ?..ll t:hat kind of stuff. Not

even giving me a chance, see. But anyway, when they was phasing

it out, this is Model Cities program and they were supposed to have

qualified Model Cities workers in there. Then they should have

been ,:he ones that phased it out. Don't you think so? Well, it

didn't work that way. They were all upper middle class employees

that was phasing it out. So I went to the director and I said,

"Well, Mel, it looks like they're phasing it out. And you're going

to have five employees." "That's right, Marguerite. We got to

phase it out." I said, "Well, where's your Model Cities employees?"

"Well, we got to phase it out. We just haven't got any." I said,

"Oh," I said, "That's not what HUD said. HUD didn't say that."

"Well, we got to phase it out." I said, "Okay. You go ahead and

phase it out that way and HUD's going to know about it. 'Cause

I'm going to see that HUD knows about it." So I talked to one of

the HUD's upper men that had come in there, you know. So, I had

already talked to him about it and told him about it. He said,

"If that happens, then let me know." So I told Mel, I said,

"HUD's going to know 'cause I'm going to let them know about it."

I didn't lose my job. So you see how I had to fight all the way

down with mine. And use the old thinker that might have been hit-

ting on six, or whatever it was hitting on. And I didn't lose my

job and went on from there over to the community - ah, what is that

Mike Chitwood's over?

L

The Redevelopment Agency.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 34

L

Was he in Model Cities?

MB No, uh-ugh. But you see they had some projects they were still

holding over.

L

And Redevelopment was one of them?

MB No, Redevelopment - they went in - Redevelopment took them over.

L

They took over some of the projects that ...

MB Uh-huh, that Model Cities had. But when I got in there I had to

evaluate. They had this program where they were going out helping

people .·.

L

Giving loans?

MB Yeah. Not loans but just give them money, $2,500, I think it was.

L

You were involved in that?

MB So, finally I just got to the place where - when I was near to re-

tirement, I said, "Shoot, I'm going to retire. Howard's retired."

So I told Mike I was leaving. And I recommended a girl that - she

was a Black girl too - recommended her for my job. And so Mike

said, "I don't think we're going to hire anybody to replace you.

But if we do, we'll think about her." Well, he said, "Why are you

quitting? You're in line for a raise?" I said, "I'll tell you

why. I'm quitting, Mike, for one reason, I want to. And another

reason I'm quitting, I am so sick of seeing money given by the

federal government to help poor people and you give them $2,500

or something like that and send me out to see how they like it.

And you haven't got an employee sitting in here except your sec-

retary that's drawing less than $1,000 a month. That's why I'm

quitting. I'm tired of seeing this money distributed to the poor.

Because everybody's sitting up there drawing over $1,000 a month."

L

For ...

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 35

MB Well, sitting up there making out these projects to help these

poor people get this $2,500 and send the carpenters and things out

there and do a lot of stuff that the people didn't want. They had

so many of them they had to write, you know. So many of these

grants that they had to give.

L

Are you saying that you felt that things were kind of a fraud?

MB Well, not a fraud but the fact that the poor people were not get-

ting it like they should be getting it. They could give those

people more money than that. They didn't have to have all those

employees in there running out trying to find people to do this

for. Two or three people could have done that or maybe two . And

they'd have six or seven sitting up in there doing the same thing.

L

And that would be a large chunk of money going to them.

MB Why - of course. That's one reason I'm quitting. I'm sick of it.

And the poor people had to fight so hard and write up, what do

you call these things that they have to write. Oh, golly, my mind

has gotten blank, but anyway, they had to write to try to get a

grant and try to get some money from Model Cities and Model Cities

when we first started out sitting up there with millions of dollars

to spend. And the police forever coming in, if you don't give me

this, I'm going to scuttle the program. Tactical squad. Then I

rode one night with the tactical squad and he liked to kill me.

All these police after - had heard of a robbery and they went down

there and all these police cars gathered. And this one I was

riding with went under this viaduct and another one was coming

down this street and I think we missed by about that far.

L

The two police cars?

MB They had to have it. They had to have it. And it cost up in the

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 36

thousands of dollars to run it.

L

The tactical squad?

i'iB

Yeah.

L

Model Cities paid for it?

:,rn And the Commissioner said if you don't do it I' 11 scuttle it.

And they did it. Well, after Model Cities lost their money, I

noticed that they didn't have to have the tactical squad. It

wa s defunct in no time.

L

You fought a long time.

~B

You're not kidding.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 2, p 36

thousands of dollars to run it.

L

The tactical squad?

MB Yeah.

L

Model Cities paid for it?

MB And the Commissioner said if you don't do it I'll scuttle it.

And they did it. Well, after Model Cities lost their money, I

noticed that they didn't have to have the tactical squad. It

was defunct in no time.

L

You fought a long time.

MB You're not kidding.

Side 3

*

· What was that. That they called it? And they had it parked down

there close to the Mormon Temple. Maybe they still got it. I

don't know. Oh ... I can't think of the name of the thing.

L

Do you remember that too?

MB Yes, but I don't remember the name of the tank.

L

Was this the tactical squad again?

MB Well, no, this was practically - I think the whole state had a

part in that thing. You know.

L

Well, how did it all happen?

MB Oh, they just had the rumor that the Black Panthers were coming

in here. It was during the civil rights movement and that the

Black Panthers were coming in here to destroy the temple. And

they went all out. They had that thing, that temple surrounded

you couldn't have got through there if you'd been an ant.

*

They had the temple ~urrounded with police and then they brought

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 37

this ...

MB Riot tank.

*

Riot. Yeah, riot tank.

L

I didn't know about that.

MB You didn't?

L

No, I didn't know about that. No.

MB Even with the USO. You know what that is?

L

Yeah, that was during the war.

MB Do you know they had the terriblest fight around here that you ever

seen in your life. Trying to find a place for those Black soldiers

to go. A USO for them.

L

A separate USO?

MB Uh-huh.

L

I didn't know that either. What was the fight? What happened?

MB It was those for having one and those who were against them?

You know, it was just like, uh, them - building these security

places, you know, where people come out of prison, these halfway

houses, they call them or something, where they come out of prison.

It was just the same thing, "We don't want them in our neighbor-

hood. We don't want them here. We don't want them there."

Soldiers fighting for the United States and didn't even want them

to have a place to relax and have fun. It finally ended up in

the Baptist Church. They had moved. Our new church. I think

that's where it was, wasn't it, Howard? That Baptist Church?

L

Calvary.

MB No, no, no. But it was the one that's up on 13th East now. They

had it down there on 4th.

*

And what was it for?

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 38

L

The USO?

MB The USO. Every place that they would find, they would say 'no'.

*

Also out there at Camp Williams. You know Camp Williams?

L

Why don't you come over here. Would it be okay if he came in here

and sat here?

*

Well, also there at Camp Williams, when the war was going on, why

they set it up as a Black military police camp.

L

Camp Williams?

HB Yeah. An~ they were training Black soldiers for military police.

And they would send military police from Camp Williams to patrol

down here in Salt Lake City, especially around the depot, where

the soldiers would congregate, you know. But the Black military

police couldn't carry a gun. All they had was billy clubs but the

white military police had guns and billy clubs. But the Black

police, military police couldn't carry guns. But they patrolled

two together all the time up and down the street and around where-

ever their soldiers would congregate, you know. Like bars and

stuff like that. But they co~ldn't carry a gun. Just billy clubs.

But the white military police all through the Union Pacific Depot,

Rio Grande Depot, on the trains and everything, they had guns and
billy clubs. That's all r. wanted.

L

I had no idea about that either.

HB Yeah.

L

Did a lot of Black people come in during the war years as you

remember?

HB Yes. There were quite a few Black people came in and, uh, one of

the big problems during those years was around the Provo area.

They had - see that steel plant was down there and they were getting

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 39

Black people coming in to work at that steel plant and around

down there and they couldn't find housing 'cause the people wouldn't

rent them no houses. And a preacher from down in Provo came up to

the capitol when they had a civil rights bill that was coming up

and he came up and explained to the legislature that the Black people

were having a hard time trying to find a place to stay down there

in the Provo area and we were in a war and they needed, they needed

some kind of housing · and they had to provide that kind of housing,

provide some kind of housing for them. So I imagine - I don't know

specifically, but they must have found some kind of housing down

there but he had to come up here to the legislature to protest

against the discrimination that was down there. They didn't want

no Blacks living down there.

L

That has stayed a pretty white area until today.

HB Oh, yes. Because at one time why we'd come from down in Carbon

County, coming up to Salt Lake and probably wanted to stop at one

of those grocery stores or something and they didn't even want to

wait on us.

L

When you went to get groceries, huh?

HB No, not even to get groceries. Didn't want you in there, in their

place. But, I thought I'd just mention that about these military

police. Oh, boy.

L

It must have been kind of sad, seeing them not as equipped.

HB Oh, yeah. But, of course, they had some great big guys that could

take care of themselves, you know. But, they didn't have no pistols.

L

Yeah, I could see, I could see that they're saying something,

aren't they?

HB Uh-huh. Yeah, because at that time why we didn't have the city, on

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 40

the city, we didn't have any police officers and we were fighting

to have some police officers so they finally said, "Well, w~'ll

let you have a police officer." And we told them, "No, we don't

want no one police officer. Now, what chance would one Black

police officer have by himself. At least get two and let them

patrol together." But even under those circumstances a Black

police officer couldn't arrest a white man. Just patrol down there

amongst the Blacks and arrest them if they were doing something but

couldn't arrest no white man. That's the way it used to be. Sad

situation. Of course, it's changed now, but that's the way it was

then.

L

This was during the war when you guys wanted that policeman?

HB Yeah, during the war and maybe a little after, because we didn't

have no police officers around here. We finally got some. Now,

we got them in sheriff's department and every place.

L

What happened to your wife? Did she take off?

HB Huh. Marguerite? Maybe she went to the bathroom.

L

It's nice to see you again.

HB Well, it's good to see you. I got a lot of work I got to do. I'm

trying to get ready to go deer hunting this weekend and I got lots

of work that I should have been doing but I didn't do, to get ready,

you know.

L

Are you going deer hunting with a bunch of friends?

HB Well, my son's corning up from California and my son here. We three

are going together and then some of my friends and then I have a

nephew and his wife that's corning from Kansas and then my brother

in law and a couple of his friends are going. We'll all be up there

together.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 41

L

We wondered what became of you.

MB Well, I was trying to find something about this USO that we was

talking about?

L

Yeah.

MB Now, these headlines, USO Council changes to give Negroes Center.

REcommendations were established for a Negroe USO Center at 201

East 1st South Street and coordinated USO activities for all other

enlisted and non-commissioned military personnel at 57 South State

Street will be presented to the Salt Lake USO Council Friday night.

And, now that's one of the places. And another. This is in 1944.

"I do not live so far from the colored USO and furthermore I have

no objections to the boys that are giving their lives for our

country, having a place where they can relax and rest. How can

people be so narrow at a time like this when Black and white alike

are giving their lives for the country. You people do not object

to the Japs or yellow race with whom we are at war attending the

University and eating at the best hotels. But you do object to a

man in Uncle Sam's uniform having a few moments of relaxation."

Now, that was one of them. And then where is it - and another one

wrote that the blood of Negroe troops will flow as red as any and

they don't even want them to have a place to relax. And finally,

this is one on June the 10th.

L

1944, again.

MB Uh-huh. The USO Council approves Negroe Center. That's what I

was talking about. The fight that they had.

L

You two are a special pair. You are. I've realiy enjoyed coming

into your home and talking to you.

MB We kind of like to rag it.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 42

HB We might not be exactly accurate on a lot of things but you can get

the gist of it.

L

I'm impressed that you saved this as carefully as you have.

MB Oh, I think I got about four.

L

Four of these?

MB

Uh-huh. '

L

Would it be possible to browse through these things for a couple of

days?

MB Well, there's really not that much interest in there. You know.

That you would be interested in.

L

Some of this stuff, I'd like to copy.

MB You see this little box of ...

L

Oh, is that the play?

MB Yeah. I played in that play.

L

You participated in it?

MB Uh-huh. I was in it. We played five nights at Kingsbury Hall.

Five nights and they would call us to rehearse at 10:00 at night.

And I had to get up and go clear up to the University or Fort

Douglas or some place to rehearse. But it was the grandest time I

ever had.

L

Was that during the war years?

MB Uh, I believe it was. I can't remember when this was. I didn't

write it down on there.

HB Now, we don't want to give you the impression that we're trying to

make a mountain out of a mole hill.

L

There is a mountain. there. You're not making it :

MB 1956. 1956.

is

L

I tell you this/one mountain you couldn't make.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 43

HB We're just trying to show you the way we saw it.

L

Well. ·.

MB Yeah, it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy. And I'm going to tell you

the truth. Do you want to know the truth? I'm so glad that I'm

not out there competing still in this white man's world for a job,

for a life, for a living. I'm so glad. Because it hasn't been

easy. Makes you want to shed blood. Never thought I'd ever feel

like that. But like I told you before that I could have killed when

they did me like they did on my job. It was alright as long as I

was working in a laundry or in a menial position. As I said,

assistant, special assistant to the director and didn't have a

thing to do. They was paying me $490 a month. You know wages

wasn't as high as they are now. $490 a month to sit there and do

nothing because they didn't want to train me to do anything.

L

So they'd just rather give you the money.

MB Give me the money and tell me "Well, Marguerite, write this, or

Marguerite, look into that and make some other department mad." Me
In Model Cities. Just make them mad. /meddling in their business.

L

So they set you up as a patsy?

MB Uh-huh. I wasn't anything but a token. That's all. There was a

guy working in there by the name of Sam Moll and I was talking to

him one day and he said, "Well, Marguerite, what do you think you

was hired for?"

L

What was he hired for?

MB Oh, he was respected. He was the assistant to the director at that

time, I think. And was over what they called the department that

went out and visited the poor people in the neighborhood. Aides.

And they would go out and visit all the poor people in the neighbor-

hood, and try to help them with their problems. And there was one

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 44

project over there on and it was down on 2nd West at that time.

And they were just getting Model Cities' money and hiring their

relatives to go out and babysit or do this or do that and they

weren't doing one thing. Not one thing. Go home and sit down and

draw that money. Well, when I wrote the evaluation on it, I rec-

ommended that they be defunded. Oh, everything broke loose, you

see. And they sent this guy by the name of Bill with his Phd down

to evaluate it. To see my evaluation. He went down there and he

came back with a recommendation that they be funded and give them

another chance, you know. And the Commissioners got a hold of that

'cause they didn't like the woman that was running the thing anyway,

all of the Commissioners. And they recommended that they fire

Bill. That Model Cities fire him. Because they come and ask me,

"Well, Marguerite, what do you think about Bill's evaluation?" I

said, "It stinks. They snowed him from top to bottom. They really

snowed him. And I still stand on my feet that they be defunded."

And they were defunded.

L

What happened to Bill?

MB Well, he went - Model Cities was about to phase out at that time

so they just let him go.

HB Probably got promoted.

MB No, he didn't get promoted. I don't know what happened to him but

I know good and well they recommended that he be fired. 'Cause

they wanted to get rid of this Dorothy Pulley, anyway. Crying

Dorothy, we called her. She'd come to the information meeting with

all her - for all her funds and the next thing you know, the tears

would just be flowing. She was just crying and the Commissioners

started calling her Crying Dorothy. It was fun working for Model

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 45

Cities. It really was.

L

It seems a little bit like, like another era now.

MB A what?

L

It seems like another era, another time period.

MB Oh, yeah. There'll never be another era like that again. But you

know, even though Model Cities, they fought Model Cities so hard.

But you know Model Cities did more for the poor people than any

other project they've ever had in - that the government has funded.

Because it taught the people to stand on their own feet. That they

may not win but they could fight city hall. And they did give city

hall the blues. The poor people. All of them weren't that poor.

But nevertheless they were right in that area where they wanted

things and they fought till they got things. How do you think they

. got Redwood Center? How do you think that they got that - over on

the west side - that center? Anderson. Sunday Anderson Center.

How do you think they got that? How do you think they got Northwest?

Model Cities got it for them.

L

Every one of those?

MB Every one of them. Model Cities got it. How do you think they

got the - over, out on Redwood Road. They got a sidewalk that goes

over the highway?

L

Yeah.

MB Model Cities got that for them people out there in that area. But

they weren't doing any good. But those people would meet every week.

Every week and tell Model Cities what their problems were. And a

lot of them were solved through Model Cities.

L

Which had the funds available to help them.

MB Yeah, yeah.

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 46

L

And had to do with community cooperation.

MB Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

L

Some kind of partnership of some sort.

MB Oh, yeah. They set up-in every area they had councils. Every area.

Had councils. And those councils met every week.

L

That farm life that you began with stood in good stead throughout

the years. Made you willing to work hard.

MB And the - the farm life and working hard didn't stop me from learn-

ing all the little ins and outs of society either. (laugh) They

didn't because I can play bridge with the best Qf them. Or any-

thing else. There isn't anything I can't do. I can do anything,

see? And I wouldn't take anything for it. I'm not ashamed to do

anything, see? And it's paid off. Even when it came down to

fighting for a job.

L

Especially then. You've got to learn to fight, it seems.

I said, you've got to learn to fight.

MB I learned that. I learned that you had to learn to fight. I know

when I was working in the Redevelopment and Mike had a secretary.

She didn't want me to have anything. She wouldn't do anything for

me I'd ask her for. You know, I'd ask her for some tape for my

recorder. "Oh, well, we don't have any, Marguerite." Well, you

know, I know, every department has plenty of tapes that they're

supposed to supply. So, I didn't say anything but when she held up

my payroll report, she held it up, she didn't have any business with

it in her hands, see. But when she held it up and it didn't get to

the department, then I raised up again. And I went to Mike Chitwood

and I told him about it and I said, "I don't want her hands on

nothing I've got to send over to that other building. Now, I don't

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 47

want her to have it." "Oh, Marguerite, don't make waves." Well,

this was when I was ready to retire. I said, "Mike, I'm not going

to make waves. But the whole ocean's going to fall in on you."

I'm not going to make waves, but the whole ocean, 'cause that's

too little. But I learned that when you stood up for yourself and

not say, "Yes, sir, no sir. I won't do that, I won't do this."

Stand up for yourself, they got more respect for you. They had

more respect for me, I can tell you that. Shauna and I got to be

the best of friends. We did. She wouldn't think about having a

dinner party or something like that without inviting Howard and I.

L

I met her and her husband.

MB You did?

L

Yeah.

MB Odd couple.

L

Yeah. (laugh)

MB Odd couple. Very. Very odd couple. But they took that old house

up there on 2nd Avenue. In fact, it's two houses . One below the

other.

L

A duplex?

MB No, they live in it.

L

They live in both?

MB Uh-huh. But it could be converted into an apartment house. You

know, I'd call it more an apartment house because it has everything

on the upper floor that it has on the lower floor area. But they

really made it lovely.

L

They did a nice job on it, huh?

MB , Uh-huh.

L

I've met him through the University.

Marguerite Browne 10=19-83 Side 3, p 48

MB Is he still working in the Indian affairs?

L

Largely, yeah. Largely. He's an unusual man. He's done some

good things. I think, you know, I think he has some difficulties

too. He's a distant man. I think he has some difficulties with

the people he's working with, from what I've seen. That's neither

here nor there. It's just what I saw. Well, I'm going to have to

go.

·

MB

I think I've told you about all I know. About myself.

L

You know, you've made, you know you've made a good recovery from

everything I've heard but I can see more now why. Why you've

bounced back.

MB Why? 'Cause I'm willing to fight?

L

You want to live and yes and it's hard but you've taught me some-

thing.

MB I don't know how.

L

It's hard. Fighting is hard. It's hard to keep fighting. Some-

times you want to quit.

MB

I told you that after I got let out of that, uh, out of the airport,

I just didn't want to go out anymore. And look for a job. And then

I saw Model Cities coming on and I said, "Now, there's no point in

me sitting here working for this girl just me helping her out for a

$1.50 an hour. I know I can get that job. I knew it because I

knew too many of the - I knew all the Commissioners, you see. And

I said, "I'm going to get that job if I have to go to the Commiss-

ioners." There was one little dumb girl working out there, a woman.

It wasn't no girl. This woman. And "Marguerite,· why don't you

come on out and apply for a job." And then she turned around to

the other girl and said,

"She won't do it because she thinks -

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 49

because she's colored she won't get it." And then I saw red.

White and blue. But I didn't jump her because I knew she was ig-

norant. She's just one of those people that never been out in the

world. You know. Like when I was working up to the City and County

Building as a janitress. We were having a Christmas party and they

were having it at the Ambassador Club and, uh, they had us in a

room. It wasn't the main dining room, you know, because naturally

they don't have Christmas . parties in the main dining room. So, we

were in a room back of that and this guy said, "Yeah, we're having

it up at the Ambassador Club but they're having it in another room

there 'cause Marguerite will be there." And there I was on the

program. (laugh) I said, "Oh, why don't you wake up." But I did

tell him, I said, "No, they're not having it in that room because

of me. They're having it in that room because they don't have

Christmas parties in the main dining room."

L

That gives a sour note to it all, doesn't it?

MB And another one that was working in the same department, they had

a musical at Westminster and this Black was singing and she said,

"I want to go but do you think I'll be welcome?" And I looked at

her, "Lucy, anything that's public, you should be welcome at. You

should know you'd be welcomed at anything that's public." I just

don't know - I don't think it'll ever happen that people will real-

ize that people are people. I don't care what color you are. When

it all comes down, as they say, 'if push comes down, to shove',

we're all alike. We may be raised differently but we still all want

the same things. If they call themselves Christian, we're all

working for the same thing. That's all we want. I've had people

walk up to me, you know, white people and ask me, "Well, what is

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 50

you're fighting for? What do you want?" I said, ''What do you

have? I want the same thing you got. I want a home, a car, and

I want to raise my children and educate them just like you do.

Anything you have, I want too. You got a good job, I want a good

job. If I'm capable of holding it. That's all I want. I don't

want your son or your husband. I don't want him. I don't want

that." But that's what you see - the white man all during that

time, the civil rights time - fight. That's all they thought that

we were fighting for. Integration so that we could mix.

L

You mean that's what they said or thought you wanted?

MB Uh-huh.

L

That's the way they got people's blood up in this country. For a

long time. A long time.

MB Well, you see, that's the way the southern politicians won the

elections. Because the Black couldn't vote. At that time they

didn't have any franchise and those that did, why, there was, you

know, quite a few, but not enough and they weren't interested in

it because it didn't mean anything to them. See? Because one

white man was just the same as the other. And, just like Wallace.

When Wallace first run for an office there, he lost and the state-

ment that he made, it was published I think in one of our papers.

But the statement he made was, "I'll never be outniggered again."

And he wasn't.

L

I remember that too.

MB And that's the way they won in the south, the politicians.

L

But he's back now.

MB Uh-huh. And the Blacks put him back.

L

I know. That is the strangest story. God, that's a strange story.

Marg-uerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 51

L

Yeah, I remember Wallace was one of the ones that was involved in -

I remember - keeping some students standing in the door.

MB And another one was Governor Faubus. Only he didn't stand in the

door.

L

He was from Arkansas.

MB Arkansas, yeah. And do you know, he didn't have anything against

Black people. Not a thing. We went down to his office and he

was - what's this guy - Mike Wallace - uh ·..

L

Sixty minutes?

MB Yeah. Mike Wallace was there. He left Mike Wallace like that.

And come out there and shaking hands and all. I thought he was

going to kiss us. He was so happy that we came down there. He

sent his own kids away from Arkansas to go to school.

L

Really?

MB Yep. The most gracious person you'd want to meet. I imagine -

Bill Boyle - you wouldn't know him. He was back in my days. He

was a Senator. Oh, God, we took the Congressional Record, you

know. And some of the things that man said about Black people.

He said, "They're smart when they're young, but by the time they

get eighteen, their skull fossifies and won't let their brain grow."

And that was printed in the Congressional Records. Yes, and when

he got ready to die he told the Black people that he didn't have

anything against them, but he had to win the elections.

L

But he had to win the elections.

MB Win the elections. And that's the only way he could do it. Was

getting out there, you know those hillbillies and things, you know.

The back country whites. It's still - you think it's good down

south, it's better, you know. They're talking about it - don't

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 52

you get out of them big cities. Don't you get out of them big

cities 'cause they'se just as bad as they were. I don't think

they're as - as far as lynching parties goes, but any other way,

all the other ways that they had of humiliating you. They still .·.

Just like when I went down to Shreveport, Louisiana in 1969. Now,

I was on an Army base so everything was hunky dory, you know, on

an Army base. Drive right out the gate of the base, was a laundry

mat and across the window, "No colored trade solicited."

L

No colored trade ...

MB Solicited. Now, that was in 1969.

L

Across the street from the Army base.

MB Uh-huh.

L

Well, I tell you, you know, there are a lot of, I mean, you don't

have signs out in windows in this town here, but, uh, it's clear

that there's a good deal of discrimination going on here. In this

town. In terms of work, in terms of where people live. In the

school system. It would depend where you are, what school, what

teacher, what not but, uh, from the contact I've had. I mean, there

are a lot of positions I've been where Black people are hired very

slowly. Or mostly not hired at all. Mostly, they're just not hired.

MB

. It's just Coors. They talk about Coors now, you know, being one of

the top employees from minorities. I remember the time that Coors

said they wouldn't hire a Black man.

L

Who says Coors is one of the top ones?

MB That's what they're saying now. I heard it.

L

Is that right?

MB Uh-huh. I wonder who it was. Somebody who was working there or

something like that.

L

Well, Mrs. Browne, I'm going to have to go because I'm going to be

Marguerite Browne 10-19-83 Side 3, p 53
late to an appointment. But I'd like to thank you for spending the morning with me and telling me about, about telling me about yourself. Uh, if it would be okay, perhaps I could come back sometime and look this over a little bit more carefully. MB Yeah. Maybe I can find something else that might interest you.
