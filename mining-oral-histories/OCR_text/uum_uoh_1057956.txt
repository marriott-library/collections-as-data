 THIS IS AN INTERVIEW WITH T . DEE TRANTER OF THE MOAB, UTAH RADIO ST A TION FOR THE COLORADO PLATEAU URANIUM PROJECT , AUGUST 11, 1970 . THE INTERVIEWER IS STEVEN GUTTMAN .
SG: As an introduction to the tape, can you give me some background on yourself? When did you come to Moab?
TT: Well, I've only been here about five years, that is, as a resident. I come to Moab the first time about 1949 and again in 1952, but just for real short periods. Then I moved here about five years ago, a little less than five years ago, and I've been at the radio station ever since.
SG: What brought you to Moab the first time in '49?
TT: Just a vacation. My folks took a vacation, and we come to Moab to see the Arches. My father had a real good friend that worked at Arches National Monument as a ranger at
that time, and we come down to visit and see the area.
That was before the uranium boom.
SG: What did the town look like?
TT: I got a sight of it before the uranium boom. Then, in '52
when I came here, I came here right out of high school, and we come down looking for some work 'cause we had heard, you know, about the big boom going on in Moab, and so we come down looking for something to do. They were right in the midst then of filming a movie. I think it was one with John Wayne at that time. At any rate, the town was really popping. We came to Moab, and we did n 't find any work right off so, but it was kind of interesting to see the change that had taken place in

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
just those couple years.
SG:
TT:
What were the major changes that stuck in your mind between '49 and '52?
Well, the number of people that were here. The town was really booming, you know, and the streets were full of people. You'd drive around the streets of Moab and you'd see literally people living in tents, small trailer homes. We stayed out at the old city park at that time because we just brought our sleeping bags with us, just kids out of school, and so we slept out at the old city park, and we had a lot of company, a lot of guys sleeping in sleeping bags out there.
The city didn't hassle them or anything.
No.
There was no problems?
No, I don't think so, or at least I didn't notice any. We just threw our sleeping bags out in the park, and that's where we stayed. We were only here for a few days. The city mainly didn't put any restriction on this because of the lack of housing, the lack of hotels?
I think this is it. In fact, I think this has affected the city at the present time because you look at the number of trailer homes in the city, even in the downtown section where most cities would have a restriction on a trailer home. I think _ this has affected it because at
SG: TT: SG: TT:
TT:

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
this time there wasn't any housing. There was no place to stay. So people started moving in in trailer homes, the only thing available, and they put them on any vacant lot they could find; consequently, it still affects the city.
SG: Isn't there still a shortage of low cost housing in this city if you don't count trailers?
TT: That's probably right. There are a lot of trailer homes in Moab. Our trailer home population is quite high.
SG: For the size of the city, it's a high percentage. Were there any other things you noticed besides just the large number of people?
TT: Well, it was kind of exciting at the time, especially for us, you know, just out of the back woods anyway, because of all the movie stars over here at the time. They kind of centered around the old Arches Cafe up here that is now gone. That was the headquarters, or pretty much headquarters. As I remember it, the headquarters of the movie company was across the street there where the library is now, or on that corner. They put up a shop there. We waited in line for a while, looking for some jobs and never did find any there.
SG: Was that typical, do you think? Do you think most of the people that come in were unsuccessful in finding jobs and left?
TT: I don't know. Well, we had heard the rumor that they were
3

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
begging people to come to Moab to work because there were all these jobs down here. When we got here, it seemed to me that there were far more people than there was work. We checked at the Employment Security Office then and didn't find anything there. Then, as I say, we waited in line over at that movie company just kind of generally nosed around and didn't find anything. Maybe if we had stayed here for a longer period, but you know, we were only here for a few days.
And what was your home town?
Nephi, Utah originally, over in the central part of the state.
SG: But the rumors at that time had been throughout the state about the riches to be found here?
TT: Oh yeah. This was right after Charlie Steen discovered his big mine. The story was that there was a lot of work in Moab, a lot of things going on 'cause there were a lot of things going on. Kind of interesting. It was interesting the contrast just those couple of years in visiting the city.
SG: The first time you came down there, weren't you kind of untypical? There weren't too many tourists that were coming to this area at that time, were there?
TT: No, I don't think there were many tourists. It wasn't really known as a tourist-oriented town. Oh, I think a
SG: TT:
4

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
couple of the attractions were pretty well known, Dead Horse Point and Arches mainly. But Canyonlands was unheard of then. That was just a vast wilderness. Nobody had really promoted it and nobody ever heard of it as a tourist attraction.
SG: When do you think Moab first became known as a tourist attraction? Was this after 1960, or did it actually start before that?
TT: I would say, really, the time the area really became known as a tourist center would have been at the time Canyonlands National Park was being promoted. Then, of course, as you probably know, there was some controversy over how much of the land was going to be set aside in Canyonlands National Park, and there was some local hassle over what lands would be included and which wouldn't; and consequently, this attracted attention, at least around Utah. I think this was the real start of the tourist business in southeast Utah, in Canyonlands. People began to say, "Well, here, if they're going to set aside a national park, maybe there's something down there." I think this was the real start.
SG: Was this about the time some of your big hotel chains started coming down in this area or had they already come in because of the uranium boom?
TT: Well, I don't think any of our motel chains have really
5

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
came in until the last couple of years.
SG: They've all been a recent development with the tourism? TT: Yeah, because when I come here five years ago, we had the Desert Lodge, which was privately owned. It wasn't owned by one of the chains. It was the biggest motel in the town. Since then, it has changed hands and become the Ramada Inn. Then we have the new Travel Lodge. Those are really the only two you'd call chain motels, and they
were both established within the last couple years.
SG: You think the future of Moab is going to be in tourism, or do you think mining is still going to play a fairly
substantial role?
TT: I think mining will play a substantial role for a number
of years in Moab, but I think the real money to be had in this area is through tourism. If the area really prospers, it will come through tourism, and mining will be secondary. I think the switch here, the balance, is going to change more each year towards tourism over mining. The mining industry you will see going down not so much in volume, but as--
SG: In relation to--
TT: --in relation to the tourist business, because I think
the tourist business is going to increase quite a bit in
the next couple of years.
SG: But you view this more as a gradual thing; nothing as
6

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
dramatic as, well, the uranium boom coming in?
TT: Well, now, I don't think you'd ever see anything like that in the tourist business. But more and more the state and the national parks are pushing people to visit some of the out-of-the-way places. Our national parks are becoming very overcrowded, some of them, and so the park people are beginning to promote some of their less visited areas, and that's us. So consequently, I see the park service promoting Canyonlands more and more; Canyonlands and a lot of other areas that aren't visited as much now or as heavily as some of the other area, like Yosemite, where they're pretty much overrun, you know.
SG: Yeah, that's a mess. A lot of the local residents seem to be a little bit upset with the park service on a couple grounds. One is that as present plans now stand, Canyonlands is going to remain about 80 percent wilderness. Have you heard any comments?
TT: I've heard a lot of comments, yeah. Do you want my personal feelings?
SG: Yeah.
TT: I'd like to see part of it stay wilderness area. I think
a big attraction of Canyonlands is its wilderness area. I think if we plow too many roads in there, we're going to destroy Canyonlands. There's not going to be anything left to it. Let's fact it, a guy can spend two weeks in
7

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
Moab and not get off the paved roads at the present time and still not see all of the sights. That's not to say that we couldn't still develop some roads, but I think the cry that we don't have any developed roads is a little over-played. I personally think that the wilderness aspect of Canyonlands is its big attraction. You don't have millions of people out there, and because it is wilderness country you can get out there and not see a person around for many miles. You can drive for a half a day in Canyonlands country and never see anybody. Personally, I think this is its big attraction.
SG: Then the long-term effects, you think, would be detrimental if they went ahead like some of the local residents seem to want, with a full development program.
TT: Well, yeah, if they developed it too much, I think it would be detrimental, definitely. I think that we could still stand a few more roads in Canyonlands, and I wouldn't object to seeing the park land concept; that is, the golden circle concept, where you connect Canyonlands with the Zion and Bryce areas and even into Colorado. This would allow somebody to travel through Canyonlands on an oiled road, on a nice highway, if the would like to do so, and sti11 see a lot of the spectacular country, and at the same time still keep great areas of it pretty
much locked up to the average tourist. I say locked up
8

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
only because most people don't make the effort to go in because it's not going to be locked up if you want to make the effort to get in. It's still going to be there, but it will still be wilderness. This is my personal
feeling. I don't voice that feeling too much, you know, because you get in an argument with a lot of the local people.
SG: The other thing that we've heard from a lot of people is this argument between single-use and multi-purpose use of the park. A lot of the residents seem to be bitter because they're only going to use it for the one purpose, strictly as a recreation are. They're not going to allow mining in there or anything like this.
TT: In such areas as Yellowstone and Yosemite there is no mining or cattlemen and there was no demand for multiple use. But when we get to Canyonlands, we have a different situation, and there is a big demand for multiple use here. I really think that we could preserve the tourist attraction and still allow multiple use such as mining or grazing, too, as far as that goes. One of our local tour operators put it this way: he said, "I've never had a tourist on one of my tours object to seeing a mine or a cow." And let's fact it, a lot of people from back East
haven't seen a cow, you know, on the open range, and so I think there is no conflict as far as the tourist is
9

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
concerned. The conflict is in the park service philosophy, and not as far as the tourist is concerned. If I have some friends come and visit me, and I take them out in some of the rough country here, they're interested in seeing a mine. That's of interest to them, especially when they see one of these way up on the side of a steep cliff and they wonder how in the heck they ever got up there to work it. I always offer to drive them up on one of those little old roads, but I don't get too many takers. I think the conflict there is in the park service philosophy and not in the tourism aspect because tourists are interested.
Do you see any change in the park service?
Not in the immediate future I don't.
You think they're pretty well locked into their plans? Yeah, I think they're pretty well locked in. It takes a keg of dynamite to move any federal agency, you know. The whole federal process moves very slow. We're well aware of that because we're a federally regulated business, and so I don't see any change in the near future.
SG: We'll kind of move over now into your present job. What is the relation between a local radio station and a small town like this? I imagine it is quite a bit a different responsibility than a station serving the L.A. market.
TT: Oh yeah. Yeah, it's quite different. We're a small town 10
SG: TT: SG: TT:

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
radio station, and we pretty much concentrate our efforts on local news. We probably spend more time in gathering new. We use a lot of things that big stations would laugh at us for. For example, you come into town and get picked up for D.W.I., and you're likely to have your name on the
radio station, you know. Get thrown in jail for driving while intoxicated, and you're going to end up with your name on the radio station; which they wouldn't do in the big city. But it's of interest locally. Who's in jail is of interest. A lot of things that in a big station they
just would laugh at. But we use them because they're of interest locally. Frankly, I think some of the big stations have lost sight of what is of interest and what isn't of interest, newswise.
SG: Of course, I imagine there's some people that would resent having names published for very minor things and then hearing their name being put over the airways.
TT: Ah, well, this is true. We get some criticism as to using people's names but I think we have to do it.
SG: We were talking about the problems you have covering the news.
TT: I don't know as we use a lot of insignificant things. They may be insignificant in the eyes of the people upstate, such as the driving-while-intoxicated charge. But we don't really consider that insignificant in a
11

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
bigger city is because of the number of them. I mean, it would be impossible to use all of them. A lot of the local newspapers use them. In fact, my brother is the editor of the local newspaper, a biweekly newspaper that's published twice a week in Utah in a city of about
12,000. They publish the complete police roster on their front page, or not always on the front page, but in the paper. They publish the whole police roster. Anybody that's charged is published, no matter what the charge is, even for speeding, this type of thing; their name's in the newspaper. We don't go that far, but we do use a lot of thing that they don't use in bigger areas. If a guy's elected president of the Rotary Club, this is new in Moab. Just a lot of things that they don't use in bigger areas. We do a ten-minute newscast every morning that's strictly local news, and very seldom do we use anything from our news wire service or off our network service on that newscast. It's all local stuff; what's going on in Moab and the Canyonlands. We use news from the Canyonlands National Park, like how many visitors there were at Arches. Then at ten o'clock we do approximately fifteen minutes of strictly local news. It
could be twenty minutes. It may go half an hour if we have a lot of it. We're kind of flexible; we do whatever we want. On heavy news days, our newscast will run longer
12

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
than they do on short newsdays or on quiet days. Then at
SG:
TT:
SG: TT:
SG: TT: SG:
12: 15 we do another ten minutes of local news, and at 5:05 we do 25 minutes. It isn't all local; we do the weather in there and the stock market report, but a good fifteen minutes of it is strictly local news.
In terms of this arrest thing again, you then follow up with the court records?
Actually, what we use is the court record. We don't use the charge when he goes into the jail or is charged. We use only when he goes before the judge and what the disposition is there.
Oh, that's a little bit better then.
So, in other words we report on the fact that John Jones went before the judge today and pleaded not guilty to a driving charge, or something like this, and then what happened when the trial came up.
If he is acquitted, this does get coverage?
Right, right.
In terms of the other type of material that you do use on the station, do you get pressures that a certain type of music be played, say?
TT: Yeah, it's a real difficult thing in Moab and, in fact, I think in any small town because we have a very small staff. We have to operate with a small staff because we can't afford to operate with a big staff. Consequently,
13

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
we've gone the direction, here in Moab, of automation. The old "Auto" in there plays most of the records and the commercials for us and pretty much does everything for us. We generally have an announcer on duty, but he may not be playing records. He may be typing a log or
auditioning some new records that have come in, or something along this line rather than sitting and playing records as most radio stations do. We don't have a disk jockey on duty except for the early morning hours, and that's me. But we get a lot of demands as to the type of music we play and it's pretty difficult because we're the only radio station here, you know. In Salt Lake or Denver, you can have a country and western radio station and a concert music radio station and a radio station that plays strictly popular top-forty and two or three others in between someplace. I don't know as I have a good answer to the type of music we play, we what we have is a rather complicated music format where we play kind of countrified popular music. We play some country music records; we play some popular music records, but we don't go over into the top forty area unless they have a little bit of that country sound and are not too far out on the rock side. And we don't go too far over on the country and western side. We try to kind of stay in the middle. Consequently, you may hear a popular music record right
14

 T. DEE TRANTER #1
next to a country and western record, but we try to build an overall image of popular music with a little country flavor in it.
SG: Well, how did you finally come to this decision to play it this way?
TT: Well, it was pretty much a random thing of using the ones we got the fewest complaints about.
SG: So, it was almost a negative criterion?
TT: Yeah, it really was. For a while, when we first put the
automation in, we subscribed to a music service out of Los Angeles--around that Los Angeles area that was supposed to have been programmed by the top professionals, and we got nothing but complaints on it, just all kind of complaints about the music we were playing. We had to cancel it and go to recording our own music here including some country and westerns and getting that country flavor back in. Since then, we still play a lot of the same records that were on these music tapes, even to playing a record by Frank Sinatra, for example, or a Dean Martin record, or something along this line, Andy Williams, but with the country music interspersed, so we don't get the complaints we got.
SG: In other words, the main complaint was a lack of country music?
TT: Well, we get two complaints, two major complaints: the
15

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
lack of the popular records and the lack of the country records. We can't go too far over one way or the other, so consequently we take kind of a middle road and play a little of both, with the major influence being on popular or middle-of-the-road type of music.
SG: Have you attempted to do any block of timing, say, making one hour nothing but country music?
TT: Yeah, in fact we used to do this prior to the time we put the automation in. But with the automation, it's a little more difficult to block program because you've got to stop and change your music. You completely have to reset your automation machine every couple hours. Every time you change it to a different block of programming, you have to reset your whole machine. You spend more time
working and fooling with the machine than it's worth. So we have to stay pretty much with the same type of music all day long, and this is the reason we have this odd music format. I've talked ta lot of people in Salt Lake and Denver and some of the other bigger areas, you know, and tell them what type of music we're playing, and they pull their hair. "You can't do that!" But we seem to get along very well right now. We're having very few complaints about the music we play.
SG: Are most of the young kids happy with this type of formula?
16

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
TT: Well, this is where most of the complaints come from when
SG: TT: SG:
we're not playing popular music, but we generally have an announcer here in the afternoon. We have some high school kids work for us, and what we do is let them intersperse this music and move our music format a little more to the popular side during the afternoons now, especially when school is in session. As soon as school is out, we begin to put in some more of these popular music records, either by way of cartridges or with the announcer playing some records, and this seems to keep them happy. Then we go back to our regular music format a little later on. So in this sense we are block programming a little bit. We change it a little more to the popular. In the morning I'm free to play--we're strictly live--whatever the mood hits me. But I'm kind of a nut. I like all kinds of music. I even like concert music; anything from Bach to Buck Owens.
So by yourself you cover the spectrum.
By myself I play the spectrum anyway.
I terns of sports programs and things like this, do you also cover most of the high school football games?
TT: Yeah, we cover high school football games and high school basketball games. Those are the two major sports here anyway. I can't think of any others we do. We don't do really any track. During a track meet, we may have a
17

 T. DEE TRANTER #1
couple of phoned in reports at the middle part of the track meet, and at the end of the track meet we have someone phone in and give the results to date. But we carry live all of the high school football all high school basketball games, including most of the preseason games.
SG: For a station your size, doesn't this cause certain problems facility-wide especially for away games?
TT: Well, yeah, it's a little expensive, but generally we have them sponsored to where the sponsor picks up the tab for most of the expense. We don't make a lot of money off these, that's true, but we do carry them. We feel that we're obligated to carry them whether or not we make a profit off of them. We feel that we need to carry them. High school football is big news in Moab. It's of interest to most of the city of Moab. So consequently we carry them even though we don't make a lot of money off of them.
SG: How about advertising? Do you get many national advertisers?
TT: No, very few. We get a little through our network service. We have Inter mountain Network News ¥ We 're affiliated with the Intermountain Network, and so any national thing we get comes through the Intermountain Network. By the time you take an account, deduct the
18

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
advertising agency commission, take the Interm untain Network's commission out, we don't have much left. So what we get is insignificant. We're strictly dependent on local business. We'd starve to death on what we get out of national or even regional business.
SG: Would you say local accounts make up about 80 percent of your advertising?
TT: At least that, at least 80 percent. SG: Closer to 90?
TT: Closer to 90 percent.
SG: Has this been true all along?
TT: Well, in fact, when I come here five years ago, we were paying the network every month. We were writing them a check every months because they charge us for the service they provide. Then, generally, what happens is that they deduct the amount of advertising due from the bill, you know, one way or another. It's a matter of whether they pay us or we pay them. We were able to work out a little different agreement with them. At the present time we are
generally on the plus side a little bit with the
networks. So we get a little money out of it.
SG: Do you get any pressures from any local advertisers to emphasize more news or play certain kinds of music or
anything?
TT: Oh yeah. Yeah, you get some pressures. You get pressures
19

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
on news. For example, you mentioned a moment ago using somebody's name. We have had an advertiser cancel his account because of using, in this case, a boy's name on the air, a boy that was involved in a narcotics charge. I used his report, and he cancelled his advertising. These kind of things happen.
SG: I've noticed, listening to the station, that you seem to be emphasizing the problems of narcotics quite heavily.
TT: Well, I think we have in the past year. I think you're going to see this ease off now. What happened is about a year ago, we released the governor's drug abuse study committee's preliminary report, which indicated that Moab was the highest in the state in the use of marijuana; or at least tied with the Wasatch Front cities. We kind of pat ourselves on the back in the fact that we were the first and for a while were the only news source that broke this information locally. In fact, the local paper
completely ignored it for a time. And a lot of people said, "Oh well, that report is phony. You can't put any stock in that." Well pretty soon we discovered it was fairly factual. So this is where the whole problem started, you see. All of a sudden we discovered we're one of the worst cities in the whole state of Utah with this problem. So consequently we've put a lot of emphasis on it. Well, the city's been concerned about it. A lot of
20

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
citizens are concerned about it. We have citizens that are banding together and forming committees, and officially appointed committees, and so forth. So there has been a lot of emphasis on this problem and a lot of pressure from local citizens to do something about it, and a lot of questions as to what we should do about it, and this type of thing. So we've covered it pretty heavily, I think, over the past year. As I say, I think
now you're going to see it ease off a little bit. I think there has been some good progress made in Moab in eliminating this problem and putting Moab back in line as the 1itt1e community it shou1d be, rather than up with the Wasatch Front cities in Utah, where the problem is obviously more serious.
SG: Coming in here, it seemed like it was kind of over- emphasized to where it could become counter-productive.
TT: Yeah, I think this has probably been true. That's why I say, I think you'll see it ease off a little bit now.
SG: You also mentioned a lot of committees have been formed on this thing. We've been doing interviewing, and we've run into a couple of people that style themselves as vigilante committees in this thing.
TT: Basically we have two committees. One has been officially formed, and that's the Coordinating Council on Drug Abuse. This includes the sheriff, the city police, county
21

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
attorney, county health office, superintendent of schools, plus a few outside people. There is a schoolteacher, there's a housewife, and a teenage, and I think that makes up the council here. I think this is a council that is really going to be productive in helping to eliminate this problem. On the other hand, we have a group of private citizens that have gotten together, and they call themselves the Citizens for Better Law Enforcement on Drug Abuse, or something like this, and their major emphasis has been to put more pressure on the judge and county attorney to be more severe, more strict in law enforcement and drug abuse.
SG: Have you have any problems with them yourself with your coverage of the drug problem?
TT: Yeah. Like I say, we lot at least one, two advertisers. SG: No, I mean in terms of this vigilante committee.
TT: Well, yeah, because we kind of get caught in the middle,
you know. No matter which way we go, we get somebody mad at us. It's pretty hard to take the middle road and stay there, and in fact we don't always try to take the middle road. We try to do what we think is right, and if that includes an editorial comment occasionally, we do it. So consequently we kind of get caught in the middle, and we did on this vigilante group. In fact we had the account that I mentioned that was dropped on one side; they felt
22

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
that we were giving too much publicity to the kids. On the other side, we had the vigilante group who said we weren't doing enough. So consequently he cancelled his advertising, and we kind of got caught in the middle of them, see.
SG: Also, in terms of being caught in the middle, I understand there's been quite a conflict over the difference between the city police and the sheriffs, and I understand that this has overlapped on the drug problem too.
TT: Y es.
SG: Have you been caught in this kind of a bind too, not
giving enough publicity to the police department for their work as compared to the sheriff's department's work?
TT: Yeah, we kind of got caught on this. Well, just as an example, we had a man that had filed for the office of sheriff and then withdrew from the race and made a rather political stated which we used which maybe we shouldn't have done, but we did. At the time he withdrew he threw
his support behind the other individual, and we kind of got a little criticism on this. Then, like I say, we haven 't been averse to contr oversy¥ We try to present both sides of an issue fairly, as fairly as we possibly can. We've tried to d this on most everything.
23

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
SG:
TT:
In terms of elective offices, especially on the local level, come election time, does the station take a position endorsing?
No, generally not. No, we don't. We generally try to steer clear of any endorsement of any political candidate. We may take a stand on an issue, but generally we don't endorse any political candidates. This has been our policy up to the present time.
Is the reason because it would cause just too much conflict with the community as a whole?
Yeah, I think it is. Well, it's pretty hard for a radio station to endorse any political candidate because of the restrictions.
You would have to give the other person equal time.
The Fairness Doctrine and the equal time provision. Consequently, it's easier to steer clear of any endorsement type of thing. When I say we may take a stand on an issue, we're still required to give the opponent's side an opportunity to voice their position. This is required under the Fairness Doctrine of the Federal Communications Commission, and we do this. I was trying to think of an instance. We had a case here, oh, on the
one I mentioned, where the political candidate withdrew. He filed for the position of sheriff, and then when he withdrew he said, "I hope everybody votes for the chief

of police", who was also running for sheriff. We wrote t the sheriff and offered him equal time because we felt the statement was political in nature. So we do make a sincere effort to present both sides of an issue.
SG: Of course in a lot of your big cities, a lot of your major stations now do take a position on candidates, and they just give the other candidates an opportunity.
TT: Yeah, but a lot of their editorials are pretty wishy- washy, I think.
SG: That's true too.
TT: They take a stand on clean streets, motherhood, you know,
and that's it. Oh, occasionally they get involved in something else, but not too much. Of course, it's pretty tough to turn out an editorial everyday too. I mean you've got to have an editorial writer. Now, for example KSL in Salt Lake, where they do an editorial every day, they have--well, actually I don't think they have anyone set aside as the editorial writer, but they have several men that do write editorials and don't have a lot of other responsibilities. Whereas here, you know, a little station like this, every man has four or five jobs. You 're not only a copywriter, but you 're a salesman, an
announcer, a newsman, and everything else--even janitor. SG: Do you get involved at all in any of the national issues around the station in terms of your editorials of your
25

 T . DEE TRANTER #1 policies?
TT: No, very little. Actually, I think we don't stress our national news; we stress local news. Of course, we broadcast the national news at least once every hour. And nine o'clock in the morning we do fifteen minutes of national news from the network, but we pay very little attention to it other than listening to it to see what's going on ourselves. But as far as talking about it or editorializing or taking a stand, we don't. You'll find, and I think this is true in most cities, in fact I think it's true of the whole population of the country, we're becoming calloused on national news. For example, you can almost rely that the first story on any national news is going to be Vietnam. They're going to do a thirty-second or a minute news story on Vietnam. I think we're becoming calloused. It goes right over our heads for most people. the average person is just becoming so accustomed to
hearing that he doesn't pay any attention to it at all. SG: To kind of shift back on to the local politics again in covering these events, do you get caught in the middle of
this in simply your straight coverage only? Do you get
into conflicts on this?
TT: Well, yeah, occasionally because we'll have somebody say,
"Well, you give his side more publicity than you give us." This vigilante group, or so-called vigilante group
26

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
and I don't know as that's a good term for them. I actually think this group did some good in the community. I think they've done several things that have been good. But at any rate, this is pretty much a good example of where we get caught in the middle. The vigilante group says, "Well, you're against us," and the other group says, "Well, you're against us." But really what we're trying to do is report the news.
What kind of issues outside of the drug thing are the so- called political issues in a town of this size?
Well, almost anything can become a political issue here. Well, like what?
Gosh, I don't know. Stop and think of an example.
W ell, come this November, there '11 be local elections. Besides drugs, which I've already gathered is going to be an issue, what other type things would become a rallying cry for one side or the other.
Oh, perhaps finances. You may hear an opponent talking about the incumbent as not being as frugal as he perhaps could be in spending the public's money. This might be an issue. I don't know--streets, maybe. I was trying to
think in the last election of some of the things that may have come up. I know this spending money was one that came up in the last election. Off hand, I can't remember what came up.

SG: Your local electi ons are partisan?
TT: Well, only partially partisan. Our mayor and city council
is non-partisan. Well, we have a citizens' party, and
then anybody else is running as an independent.
SG: Then for the county though, those are Democrat or
Republican? TT: Yeah, right.
SG: I was wondering if there ever is any kind of national issue that floats down because of the fact that they are partisan offices?
TT: Oh, I think so. I think it definitely has an influence on the local election. For example, I think if you saw the nation go overwhelmingly Republican, you'd see Republican local candidates also, maybe carried in. Course, the Moab area is traditionally Republican, and I think we only have one county office held by a Democrat at the present time.
SG: The recorder.
TT: I think she's had two people file against her for this
election. At any rate, I think she has an opponent this time.
SG: Yeah, she does have one, at least.
TT: I think there are two opponents out for the recorder's
job, both Republicans.
SG: Do the people in this area generally vote for the person
28

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
or for the party?
TT: Well, I think you get some voting for the party because of the mere fact that we have as many Republicans as we do in the county government. In other words, I think this is an indication that we do have some voting for the party because of the fact that we only have one Democrat. We have had some good people run on the Democratic party. So I think you get a little of this.
SG: A little bit earlier, during the boom, there was quite a controversy going on about things like trailer courts and sewage and things like this. Has any of this stuff lingered on to the present?
TT: Yeah, definitely. We had, about a year ago, a Grand County Planning Board set up and a study made by a group from Denver, if I remember right, for a Grand County master plan. Some of the recommendations they made were to restrict some f the mobile homes in here. That brought a little controversy, definitely, because we have a lot of people who own mobile homes and live in mobile homes in Moab. So any time you try to restrict them, why they're going to complain about it. It's an issue locally. It has been more so in the past than it is at the moment because most of these have been resolved
through this planning committee. They're made some changes in the master plan to pretty much coincide with

the wishes of the local people.

Does the isolation of this area cause your station any problems at all?
No, it doesn't cause us any problems that I can think of. In fact, if anything, it's probably been beneficial to us because you can't hear any other station in Moab, especially during the daytime.
Yeah. At nights you can pick up--
Yeah, the kids all listen to KOMA. During the daytime, it's pretty hard to pick up anything else. In fact, I went across the radio dial on the car the other day, and I couldn't hear anybody except ourselves.
You get a little static in a couple of places, but--
Yeah, that's it. So in that sense it's beneficial for us to be isolated. We don't have the outside competition. This is why we play the music format we have that I was talking about earlier because we have to pretty much satisfy everybody, or try to satisfy everybody, and try to take kind of the middle road.
In terms of your outgoing communications, say, the problems the telephone company has had over the years, does this in any way affect you?
No, I don't think so. We've had real good cooperation as far as the phone company's concerned. They kind of bend
over backwards to do us a good job, and we haven't had
SG:
TT:

 T . DEE TRANTER #1
any problems that I can think of.
SG: Generally speaking, what do you see as the direction of the radio station and of Moab in the next five years?
TT: I don't know. I'm a little apprehensive, I guess. I don't really know.
SG: Some people characterize this area as operating under a crisis economy, you know, that as fast as some things come in, other things go out.
TT: Well, I think almost all little towns get involved in this. I know in my home town, there's one big industry in the whole area. If they were to close down, there would be a crisis. Interestingly enough, I think the city would survive. I lived in Tooele, west of Salt Lake. I don't know if you're familiar with it. Five thousand people are employed at Tooele Army Depot there, right next to Tooele. Of course the rumor is always rampant that Tooele is going to close down, you know. It was at the time I was there. "The army depot is going to close down!" This brings nothing but panic to all the city fathers, you
know. In fact they've increased in size over the past five years. Nonetheless, it's this crisis attitude all the time there. And the same has pretty much been true here. We've had rumors that Texas Gulf Sulphur is going to pick up and move out. Then Atlas may be cutting back. And then the mining climate isn't especially good at the
31

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
present time. There's always some little crisis going on. Personally, I have quite a faith in Texas Gulf Sulphur; I think they're going to move ahead on this solution mining. If it works out, I think they'll be there for a number of years in the county. They may not have the same number of employees as they've had in the past, but I think they're going to be an asset to our economy for a number of years to come. And I think Atlas is. So as far as these little crises are concerned, I kind of take them with a grain of salt because I've lived with them for a long time. And I've yet to see any of these little crises actually materialize.
SG: Or at least have any long-term effects.
TT: Yeah, or have any long-term effects. As you mentioned
here, generally as one thing seems to phase out, something else takes its place. I think we're seeing this now. Texas Gulf Sulphur is cutting back. They have fewer employees now, and they have been cutting back a little the last year and a half, I think. There's not any big layoff, but as one man quits and goes someplace else, just general attrition, they don't replace him, so they've cut back their staff quite a bit. But I think that you've seen the tourism take up the void. So we have
generally the same economy now, as we had a while ago.
SG: And of course Rio Algom is going to come up with a
32

 T . DEE TRANTER #1 payroll.
TT:
SG:
TT: SG: TT:
Yeah. Here comes Rio Algom Corporation. They're moving in and increasing, so they take up the void.
How is your relation with some of these big firms like Rio Algom or Texas Gulf Sulphur?
Generally speaking, pretty good, I think.
Do you have many dealings with them?
Not a great deal. Generally, in past years, as long as I've been here a number of years before, Texas Gulf Sulphur and Atlas Minerals have both sponsored our football games on the radio, and the basketball games, league games at least just as a public service.
They couldn't be doing it for anything else.
SG:
TT: They can't do any advertising, you know, and it's been
real good for us because, like I say, it helps defray the cost for these, and we don't make a lot of money on them anyway. It's been real good for us because we haven't had to take time out for a commercial message, you know, and sometimes especially in basketball, it's real tough to spend a lot of time talking about the sponsor. All we've had to say was to give them credit for having brought the
game.
SG: How about in terms of announcers for these sports?
TT: Well, we kind of have to do with what we have. We have
one man that's a schoolteacher that has been doing our 33

 T. DEE TRANTER #1
football games. He used to do the basketball games, except I kind of get a kick out of doing basketball games myself, so I do basketball, and he still does football games. He's pretty good at it. He's been at it a lot of years and knows the kids because he teaches in the high school. So he does a real good job on football. I've done a couple of football games too, but I don't like to.
SG: In terms of sponsors on the local level, do you have much fa problem of keeping sponsors? Do they buy at a flat rate for a long period of time, or do you have to constantly sell?
TT: Well, we constantly have to have somebody in the local community talking to people because there's some advertisers that just don't want to go on a long-term contract and never will. But interestingly enough, and once again, I think this is a benefit of being isolated in the community by the fact that people are pretty much forced to listen to our radio station, so we get good results for our advertisers. An advertiser, if he goes on
the radio and puts a special on, the people will come in and say, "Hey, I heard this announcement." Or even in the case of a couple of places where we have the actual advertiser with his own voice on the air, they come in and say, "Hey, what was that you were talking about this morning?" So the advertiser knows that peop1e are
34

 T .
DEE TRANTER #1
listening, and we get results. So sales in Moab aren't nearly the problem. I worked as a salesman in Salt Lake, and that's tough. That's a tough market; here it isn't. We very seldom have the complaint that advertising doesn't work. The response we used to get in Salt Lake was, "Radio's no damn good." It's almost unheard of in Moab because people know they get results. Dixie Barker does most of the sales, and her major problem is being there at the right time to make sure she works out the right schedule for the individual. She gets a sales message and helps him work out his advertising program.
It isn't so much a case of going in and really giving him a hard sales pitch.
SG: So this hasn't been much of problem then at all?
TT: No.
SG: Is there anything else now in regard to the radio station
or the town that we haven't covered that you think we
should add? TT: No.
