WE ARE IN OAXACA, MEXICO. THE DATE IS MARCH 13, 1991. WILLIAM P. HEWITT IS BEING INTERVIEWED BY FLOYD A. O'NEIL OF THE AMERICAN WEST CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH. THIS TAPE IS DESTINED TO BE PART OF THE DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF MINING IN UTAH AND THE INTERMOUNTAIN REGIONS.
FO: May I call you Bill? WH: Absolutely. FO: Bill, where were you born? WH: Well, I was born in Manila, in the civil hospital in
1909. FO: What was your mother doing? Say nothing of your
father, but what were your parents doing in the Philippines? WH: Well my father was a master mechanic for, I believe it was Goodyear Rubber, I am not sure, back in the Cambridge/Boston area. He worked on some of the earliest automobiles: he introduced mass production to the automobile industry by grinding four cylinders at once. He was hired to go to the Philippines to build a trade school. FO: In Manila? WH: In Manila. My mother, was a Berkeley graduate in 1900. She was with the first group of American teachers who went over to the Philippines on the transport Thomas. These teachers were sent out by twos into the provinces right during the insurrection. My mother and my father met in Japan on a picnic.

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 FO: Now this is the Aguinaldo Insurrection? WH: That is correct. FO: That is interesting. Now what was your mother's name? WH: Her name was Euphemia Sinclair Paxton. FO: Where was she from? WH: The Paxton family started in the Chicago area and
they really didn't know whether they were Canadians or Americans. They migrated westerly in stages, my mother was born at Earlville, Iowa where my grandfather had a creamery, sold that and moved up to South Dakota and had a creamery there. My mother had a horror of the blizzard of 1 88 which happened when she was a little girl. From there they moved westerly to southern California and eventually she ended up in the Orange-Santa Anna country and Berkeley. FO: It is marvelous that she got through college and a very good university in those years, that early. The number of women was not great at that time. WH: Well, I will tell you this, she was a marvelous teacher. FO: Wonderful, it sounds like it, and an extremely interesting person. What was your father's name? WH: It was Harry Hewitt, really it was James Henry but he detested the James Henry, he was always known as Harry and that was the way he signed.
2

ILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 FO: So you named your son after him? WH: Yes. FO: After he served as a builder in the Philippines, what
did he do then? WH: Well, as I say, he became principal of the trade
school and they came home because of my health. FO: Oh really? WH: Yes. FO: What year did they return to the U.S.? WH: ell, I would think that it would have been 1910, the
end of 1910 but I don't know, I have no recollections of the Philippines. My earliest recollections were southwest Oregon. FO: Southwest Oregon, that would be the very wet area over by the coast. WH: Well, this would be around Medford. FO: Beautiful country. What did your father do there? WH: Well, he and a partner were trying to put in an apple orchard. FO: Oh, I see. WH: But my father's partner passed away and it seemed best to give up the place. That is when we moved down to the San Joaquin. FO: And you really grew up in the San Joaquin Valley? WH: That is right.
3

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 FO: In which town? WH: Well, it was about twelve miles south of Merced, a
little place called Athlone. It was just a way station on the railway. FO: What did your father do there, did he farm? WH: Yes, we had eighty acres and we had a sad experience. I remember he planted forty acres of wheat and the rains didn't come. The following years the rains came and the wheat came up volunteer. I can remember him sitting on his horse and the horse getting a little rambunctious and my mother trying to tell him to get off the horse. He was trying to tell her that he wasn't on the horse much of the time. (laughter) We put in forty acres of figs and we had rabbit guards on them. These darn jackrabbits would get up on their hind legs and they would girdle the trees right above the guards. I remember at the end of one year we had three fig trees left. FO: Oh heavens . WH: I remember they were doing fairly well with the hen house, so they put in two more chicken houses. My father and I had been down to the station delivering milk cans and were returning with some empty milk cans when one of the little spring zephers came by and flipped the milk cans out of the back of the
4

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 buckboard. I hopped out to grab them and as I hopped out, I saw one of the new chicken coops go up in the air and out came a cloud of white underneath it (laughter) and then the other new coop went up in the air and out came a cloud of white. We had some, probably ten or fifteen animals, cattle. One of them got tuberculosis. You know farming in those days wasn't like farming today, I can tell you. Finally we had to give up and that was when my father went back East looking for a job. My mother and baby sister stayed in California until he had a job. He taught machine shop work in a trade school in Yonkers.
FO: Do you remember the name of the trade school? WH: Saunders, it was both a technical school and a
strictly trade school. The boys in the technical school when they graduated from there, went to the finest colleges in the East. FO: So it was really more of a technological school than it was a trade school? WH: I went to Yonkers High School. FO: Were you a transfer into the high school or were you young enough that when you went to Yonkers that you began at Yonkers? WH: Boy, that was a terrible experience, when we left Southern California. I guess they went out looking
5

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 for me, threw a rope around me, lassoed me, and put some shoes on me. When we got back East, boy, that was the first time that I knew what I wanted to be, I was going to be a garbage collector because they wore overalls and drove horses. (laughter)
FO: So the transfer was traumatic? WH: Yes. FO: How old were you when that transfer was made, were
you nine? WH: Well, I hadn't quite turned nine when we arrived back
East. So I was put in the fourth grade and very promptly discovered myself back in the second. But then it was up and up and up after that. FO: The quality of the schools were remarkably different between the East Coast and the West Coast. WH: Oh, those were terrific schools. There was a school superintendent there that would not allow any interference in getting an education. There were lots of politicians that tried to do this and that but Mr. Gorton would not permit it? I believe that was his name, G-o-r-t-o-n. FO: (chuckling) I wish we had more like him today. Yonkers, in those years was an interesting community. It was very middle class. Did you like it? WH: Oh, I loved it. I had lots of friends, you could
6

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 actually go out in a vacant lot and collect mushrooms. And you could get off into the swamps and see the wildlife that was there. This was when they were just beginning to build apartments, following the very end of the first World War. Of course, we had a tremendous foreign population. These characters would come in from Europe and they would be scared stiff. They would see a subway hole and dive into it and land in a subway train and would stay on it until the end of the line and they would be up at the north end of Manhattan. So the next stop was Yonkers. No, there were no problems.
FO: Very orderly in those years. WH: Very orderly. FO: When you graduated from high school, did you graduate
well up in your class? WH: Well, I have no idea. I certainly wasn't near the
bottom, I know that. FO: I know that too. But-WH: I had wanted to go to Williams but Williams required
seventy-five or above in all subjects and I managed that in Caesar but Cicero was a different kettle of fish. I was the happiest boy in the state of New York when my regents paper came back marked sixty-six. Because I knew that paper was graded down as low as
7

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 it could go and if it had been sixty-five, I would have been scared. Sixty-six and it would go no lower. So I decided that maybe, I had better take my three years of Latin and two years of French and go to Columbia.
FO: Did you have trouble getting into Columbia? WH: Oh no, none whatsoever. FO: What do you have to say about Columbia in those
years? Who was the president? WH: Nicholas Murray Miraculous. FO: Yes, Nicholas Murray Butler, of course "miraculous"
is that what you called him? (laughter) I like that. Why did you call him "miraculous"? WH: Oh, I have no idea. FO: But everyone did call him that? WH: Everybody called him that. I can remember when he was talking and giving a speech the words would just flow like water over a waterfall but I would have no idea what he said after it was over. (laughter) FO: He is quite a figure in the history of American education. WH: Oh yes, indeed. FO: With Columbia in those years, what did you decide on as a major and what brought you to that decision? WH: Well, I decided that I would be a mining engineer.
8

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 There were mining engineers in my family, I had an uncle who was a mining engineer. I had two other uncles who had been in the Klondike prospecting. So I decided that I would like to be a mining engineer. In those days a professional degree was a six year course. The first three years were college, the fourth year you saw your first professional school requirements. I really missed the great academic teachers that Columbia was noted for in those days, like John Erskine. But as soon as I hit graduate school, then you would see marvelous professors. It was tremendous training.
FO: The tremendous training, we don't think of Columbia now as a place where mining engineering is taught as much as some other places.
WH: That is right. FO: What do you suppose caused that change? WH: Well, that is a question that I have pondered about.
The Columbia School of Mines was the first of its kind in the United States and it had a great history. I am afraid that I really am not acquainted with what has caused this change, although, there have been problems recently. Apparently the universities are looking for places to save money. I have been asked if I would lend my name to the committee that is
9

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 trying to find out what went wrong and what should be done. I can't attend meetings and all I can do is just lend them my name.
FO: Surely, however, their undergraduate program is still very strong. It is the direction of the graduate programs that have changed more radically is it not?
WH: Well, the whole program has changed radically. In those days it was a six year course for your professional degree. Today, they will give you an engineering degree at the end of four years and probably a professional degree at the end of five. You don't get this tremendous background of the academic area that I was subjected to. When I received my professional degree in 1932, there were no jobs but I had more points in geology to get my professional degree as a mining engineer than the geologist needed to get his master's.
FO: Good heavens. WH: So I had fellowships and I just stayed another nine
months until I finished up all those requirements. Then along came an offer of a job for six months in Mexico. I didn't have any money but I went over to the employment office and told them that I had no money but I had a job and could I borrow some money. I was on my way that night for six months and stayed
10

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 twenty-one years.
FO: (laughter) So you actually went directly from graduate school to a job in Mexico?
WH: That is right. FO: Where was that job? WH: Well, that job was in the mountains of northern
Mexico in the mining camp of Santa Eulalia, which was in the mountains just to the east of Chihuahua City. FO: Who was the company? WH: American Smelting and Refining Company. It was interesting. Asarco in those days did not care how much education their young men had; they kept them in their mines until the young men knew what a mine was. Not before that would they let them out to separate the sheep from the goats. FO: And a very good procedure. WH: Well, it really taught you to think, it was you against the rock. I was always in the geology department, I never worked in the administrative area, I was always a specialist. It was interesting because there were no United States Geological Survey reports to read about the properties and no maps that were reliable. It was your opinion against that rock that you were looking at. FO: That is right. What kind of ore did you mine at Santa
11

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 Eulalia
WH: Santa Eulalia--well it was base metal, eventually lead-zinc with a very nice silver content and a trace of gold.
FO: What did you do? What kind of a job did you do when you were first there? Was it geology, was it--
WH: It was detailed mapping of the old works. The mine was shut down, but there was a neighboring mine, El Potosi, that was one of the great mines of the world at that time. They were operating but our properties, I say our, the Asarco properties were closed and our chief geologist, Tom Clendenin was involved in trying to find out what the thing looked like. We were doing detailed mapping of the underground works.
FO: How old was that mine? WH: Oh, it had been in operation since the 1700s. FO: So it really was an old mine? WH: Oh, yes indeed. FO: Was it nearby to El Potosi that led to its discovery? WH: Oh no, the discoveries were made in Asarco
properties. El Potosi had none or very few of the upper level oxide bodies that Asarco had. But their ore went down in depth into tremendous bodies. FO: Tell me your first reaction to Mexico? Had you studied Spanish at Columbia?
12

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 WH: Oh no, I studied French. FO: Of course, (laughing) but you knew Latin well. WH: Not well, no just enough to pass. FO: Enough to pass and get into Columbia, I remember. WH: But I really didn't know any English until I took
Latin. It is the backbone of English grammar. Well, the first two words that I learned were on the train from El Paso south, and the first word was cervesa which is beer and the second word was butter manteguilla, which is meant to kill you. (laughing) Of course my instructions when I left El Paso, which is where the headquarters were, was to learn Spanish. FO: How long did it take you? WH: Well, it all depends on what you call speaking Spanish. FO: Lets refer to it as functional Spanish. WH: Functional Spanish. I could get along in the mines very easily within five or six months, no problem. But to get out into society is a different matter. FO: Now tell me about your reaction to Mexico? WH: Well, I thought it was marvelous. It was just like what I had known in the San Joaquin and it was right up in the frontier. You see, when I went to Mexico-Mexico had been going from the revolution of 1821. Was it? The one that separated from Spain, I forget
13

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 the date. Just one revolution after another revolution after another revolution and then into the depression and they didn't know the difference. It was almost like being back into the 1700s, early 1800s.
FO: It was pretty remote up there? WH: Oh yes, it was remote in those days. FO: The area of Mexico you said you found wonderful. What
did you find wonderful? Looking back in those years what was it that appealed to you? WH: I don't know but I sure did like it. That is a hard question to answer, it was an entirely different way of living. We could get out in the weekends and go hunting, I had good friends. I had good friends in the mining camps and good friends downtown. As I say, it was a frontier and that is what I had known in the San Joaquin. I felt I was home. FO: I see, were you still single when you went to Mexico? WH: Oh yes. FO: How old were you then? What was the year? WH: It was 1933 when I went to Mexico. FO: So you would have been about twenty-four years old? WH: That is correct. FO: When did you marry? WH: 1936.
14

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 FO: Where? WH: In El Paso. FO: To whom? WH: My wife, of course. FO: I don't know her maiden name. WH: Louise Zwick, Z-w-i-c-k. FO: What did the Zwick family do? WH: Well, her mother's family was from South Carolina and
they had been in South Carolina, I think, since shortly after the Dutch traded the Indians out of New Amsterdam. They had plantations in South Carolina. After the war, the Civil War, they hung on for awhile but eventually, without the help of slave labor, it just became impossible to make ends meet. So the family slowly emigrated westerly. Most of them as railroaders and some of them as ranchers and they ended up in the El Paso area in New Mexico and Western Texas. FO: What did they do there? WH: Well as I say, some of them were railroaders, and others were ranchers in the New Mexico area. FO: All of it in the southern tier counties, along in there? WH: No, they were up in the central New Mexico areas. When one of Louise's aunts was married with Uncle
15

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 Jack who had mining background, he was working as an office manager for American Smelting and Refining Company. That is where I met her.
FO: And you were married in '36 and you have two children?
WH: Uh-hum. FO: When were they born? WH: Well, Harry was born in 1939 and Anne was born in
1940. I figured since I was born in the Philippines that maybe we had better make sure that they were born in the states. (laughter) FO: I see, so they were born in El Paso? WH: They were born in El Paso. FO: Were you actually living there or did she go there to deliver? WH: She went there, her mother lived there. Then she came back. Both children grew up in Santa Eulalia. LH: But they studied the Calvert course with a teacher. The company maintained a teacher and there were never more than three or four, maybe sometimes five children in a class. FO: Do you think their education was good? WH: Well, it depends upon the teacher that was involved. Some of the teachers were excellent and some were not. The Mexican children, that is the children of
16

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 the Mexican engineers, did very well. When they went to high school they went to high school in Chihuahua and our children went to schools in the states.
FO: Where did you send your children? WH: Well, Harry went to Oakwood which was a Quaker School
in Poughkeepsie, New York. Anne went to a private school in El Paso. FO: How did you regard the education they received at Oakwood and at the private school in El Paso? WH: Well considering what they had to work with, I think they did pretty well. (laughter) FO: I think Harry will laugh at that comment when he reads this. The school was quite a problem then. WH: Yes, it was a problem, many people, many of the engineers sent their family out to the states for this period. That often was very unhappy. So we preferred to stay together and send the children out, whether it was the right thing to do or not, I don't know. We finally got to the point where I was on the Hurricane deck of a mule someplace down in the bottom of a barranca. My wife was back in camp running the ladies sewing circle. We had one youngster back in New York and one youngster in El Paso. Louise finally said that she was willing to trade two criadas for two children. (laughter) So I said that it was deep
17

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 enough.
LH: Morning to evening bridge games. WH: I was most surprised when I turned in my resignation
and it was not accepted. That was very unusual . Usually when a guy went into the Mexican Mining Department once you cut the mustard you never got out of it. When I left there the top brass in the mining department, the three top men, had probably a collective mining experience of somewhere between a 100 and a 120 years. FO: Oh my lord. WH: And that is something that is very hard to replace. We were trained to think like Mexicans and to get along with the Mexicans. That was our life. That was a mining department! For its time it was a tremendous organization. FO: What were you doing for them. We got to that point earlier in our conversation to where you were mapping. Then what was your next job, what was you next assignment? WH: Well, the next assignment was to go out in the hills. I guess I should explain that when you are in the central part of Mexico you would say, if you were going out in the mountains, that you were going out into the hills. But if you are on the west coast of
18

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 Mexico-Sonora or Sinaloa and you were going out in the mountains you would say you were going up into the Sierra, even if it were the same place. So I was assigned a job to look at a property down in Durango. So I took the train out to a certain station in Durango and from there I got a taxi. I forget the name of the little village where I spent the night. The next morning I got a beer truck that took me to Reyes, I believe that was the name of the area I was visiting. The driver of that beer truck had a marvelous sense of humor, much to my dismay. Now this was during the period when any formal religious observance was prohibited. So at every little village he would stop and pass the word around that I was the local cleric traveling Incognito. (laughter)
FO: That is funny, gossip spreads doesn't it? WH: Howsoever, I had no problems. FO: Were you examining properties that were already well
known and described? WH: No, they were old prospects and they were old mines
for which we had no information. My job was to get the information on it so that the company could make up its mind what it wanted to do. Whether it wanted to do some work. Actually there are only three things an exportation of geologists in my shoes could do: if
19

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 this is good get it, and if it is no good forget it, or I don't know, maybe it is worth a little bit of work. Those are the only three things you can say.
FO: What did you find down in Durango, something that was worth getting?
WH: No, but something very interesting. It could have had possibilities for a small operation, but it would have been very difficult to see the properties for a major operation that has tremendous overhead throughout the world. So we are looking at a different scale of operations here.
FO: Surely. WH: Well, then in '38 I was sent down to Santa Barbara
which is one of the great mines of Mexico. There again it was finding out what they had mined, what did the ore bodies look like, where are the possibilities, and where should we go to look for more ore? We were quite successful in Santa Barbara as we were in Santa Eulalia. FO: So they moved you into Santa Barbara? WH: Well they always kept a home for us in Santa Eulalia. FO: Is that right. WH: We would be at Santa Barbara for two or three months and back to Santa Eulalia for awhile. FO: How far apart were they?
20

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 WH: I would just say, guessing, 300 kilometers or 350
kilometers apart by road. Maybe 200 as the crow flies. FO: So it was a substantial hike? WH: Oh yes, it was completely different. FO: Two hundred miles is a long way. WH: Yes. FO: And you went by car? WH: Oh, no by train. There were very few automobile roads. We would get on the train at midnight and we would get off the train at about 4:30 A.M. in the morning. We would go to a hotel and wait until about six or 6:30 A.M. and catch the train into Santa Barbara. FO: Where did you change? WH: At a place called Jimenez. FO: Which is in Chihuahua. WH: But now they have paved roads throughout that country. FO: Oh yes, so that you can put it all in a trailer and drag it behind you. WH: If you want to? FO: At Santa Barbara, now that is a very historic area. WH: Oh yes, indeed. Santa Barbara would be--well the
21

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 Santa Barbara-San Francisco-Del Oro District I would think would be the greatest mining district in Mexico.
FO: In all of Mexico? WH: It would be a toss up whether it would be that or
whether it would be Pachuca in Hildago. They, the Spaniards, had a mint there in the 1500s. FO: So it was one of what the historians refer to as the Bonanzas? WH: Oh yes. I don't know what the historians refer to but it was a great Bonanza and still is. FO: What was the ore, was it mainly silver? WH: No, it was gold, silver, and an amalgam of the two. They were oxidized ores of course in the early days. By the time I got there, they were mining in depth and the lead-zinc-copper ores contained gold and silver byproducts. The mining was a thousand to 1,200 tons a day, drawn from various mines. FO: The smelters must have been huge. WH: Well no, those were the mills that handled the daily tonnage. Then from the mills the concentrate was sent to our smelters. FO: Where did you send them? WH: Well, the lead concentrates would go to Chihuahua and the zinc concentrates would go to--I am getting old
22

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 and knot headed and I don't think of things very fast at times.
FO: Just take your time. WH: Rosita in Coahuila, or it depended upon where the
powers that be had contracts. Then the concentrates might go up into Helena, Montana, or might go to El Paso, or might go anyplace. But mostly the lead would go to Chihuahua or the copper to San Luis Potosi. FO: So that they just milled them, got their concentrates and then separated them out. WH: Then separated them out. FO: How many different smelters did Asarco have for heavens sake? WH: Well in Mexico: Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi, Rosita, and we had big lead refinery in Monterrey, I think that is it. FO: But some of the ores actually crossed the border into the United States? WH: Yes, yes some of them did. I doubt if any from Santa Barbara crossed the border but I know that concentrates from some of our other mining camps where they had unusual byproduct elements in them went to the states. FO: Where did they get their metallurgical coke from? Are there good coal mines and cokeing facilities in
23

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 Mexico?
WH: We had excellent properties in Rosita. FO: Now that is in Coahuila? WH: That is in Coahuila. That was really the greatest
concentration of Asarco facilities in any place in Mexico--they had coal mines and they had byproduct coke plants. That was a tremendous operation. They also had ordinary scotch hearth coke plants. All of that in addition to the zinc refinery. FO: In the same area. WH: Same area. We also had a gas line coming in from Texas. It was a tremendous operation. FO: It sounds like it. Is it still there? WH: Yes, it is still there. Asarco of course has a very small interest in the properties now. When the nationalization rules came along in the early '50s, it was very difficult, very difficult. The government would allow you to operate. Well you could just keep your eyes above water but it was very difficult to get a breath of air. FO: I see. WH: Finally it got so bad that the American Smelting and Refining Company authorities said, "Look, here is 51% of our property. We don't care what you do with it, it is yours." The Mexican auditors agreed that there
24

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 was not enough money in Mexico to purchase their share of the Asarco properties. When that agreement was finally made, well then again, you could operate and see some light.
FO: Who was the president then, would this have been Aleman?
WH: Well, I don't remember. FO: Was it one of the more moderate of the
administrations or were they somewhat more radical? WH: Well, I would say that they were a little bit radical
in looking back at it. It might have been Aleman it probably was Aleman. But it was after we were moved to Salt Lake in which case it might have been after Aleman. LH: Who was before him? WH: Oh, Cardenas. LH: Cardenas? WH: No, Cardenas was--there was Camacho after Cardenas. FO: Avila Camacho was between Cardenas and Aleman. WH: Yes, that is right. Camacho was between them. FO: But those were tough times. WH: They were tough times. Fortunately the person who acquired the 51 percent knew nothing about mining and said, "Look, you folks know how to mine, go ahead and mine."
25

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #1 FO: Do it. WH: For a large number of years that worked very nicely.
Then the Mexican government said they wanted a cut, you know very well it didn't come out of the 51 percent. So that reduced the Asarco interest down to forty-nine minus fifteen which is what? Thirty-four. FO: Thirty-four percent. WH: Now the original Asarco properties are owned by a group of engineers I believe from the Monterrey area. They still have fine managers and still have a fine organization. FO: Are they mostly Mexicans? WH: Entirely. FO: Entirely Mexican? WH: But they were trained well. FO: Oh yes, they were trained by Asarco. I see how it worked. Do you know if there is still a continuing tradition of excellent training for those who take over for the next generation? WH: That I have no idea. I wouldn't know. FO: It seems to be absolutely crucial doesn't it? WH: I would think so and I would hope that is the case. I have had no experience and I don't know.

THIS IS THE WILLIAM P. HEWITT INTERVIEW IN OAXACA ON MARCH 13, 1991. THE INTERVIEWER IS FLOYD A. O'NEIL. [THIS IS PART OF THE EVERETT L. COOLEY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT.]
FO: When the company refused to accept your resignation, what happened?
WH: They transferred us to Salt Lake. FO: What year was that? WH: I guess it would have been '54. FO: 1954? WH: Probably in July. FO: This is when you got your family back together? WH: That is right. The children went to West High School. FO: What did you take over doing as a job in Salt Lake
City? WH: It was a continuation of what we had been doing in
Mexico, this was during the uranium rush. I knew nothing about uranium but I learned about it pretty fast. So I had a good deal to do with uranium operations in Wyoming and all through the west, I traveled and saw them. I was working under Walt Landwehr at that time. I never had a title all the time that I worked for Asarco until the last week when I got a little provoked, maybe I shouldn't have, and they said, "Wow, really that is a shame. " So I became a Senior Geologist. Everybody was a senior geologist.
27

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 FO: In 1954, there was also a uranium boom on the
Colorado Plateau, did you ever work down there at all, the Moab area. WH: Oh yes, I visited them. I visited them all and looked at them all. We never acquired any properties in that area, we acquired properties in the Wyoming area though. I looked at properties way down into the Yuma area. Wherever there was something to be looked at, Asarco was looking. FO: And you were their eyes in this case? WH: Well, I was one of their eyes. FO: Did you ever deal with the property that out by Grants, New Mexico? WH: No, I never worked in that area. FO: I see, the Lisbon Valley Field was pretty productive in Utah, did you look at that one in any detail? WH: Well at the present I can't remember, just where some of those areas were that I looked at. FO: Which of the Wyoming fields did you work in? WH: Gas Hills, Gas Hills is where we had properties. FO: Did you discover those properties or did you purchase them? WH: We had them under contract to purchase and I was assigned the job of seeing what they had. With my luck I don't know if I could have found anything at
28

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 all. There were radiometric showings all over our properties and I couldn't believe that they were coming from just these little pumpkin seeds, this and that, which we would find at the surface. So I finally convinced them that I wanted to drill one deep hole and I put it right in the middle of our beautiful radiometric phenomena and it was a dud. So we pulled out and I went back a few years later and I think it was Union Carbide who now had the properties. Here is what I saw: a huge open pit comes in from the north to within about a 100 feet of my hole, and there is another huge open pit coming in from the south that went to about 200 feet of my hole and I had conclusively proven that there is no connection between the two bodies. (laughter)
FO: Geology is like that, isn't it? WH: Well, I think if I were going to hire an exploration
manager I would want him to be pretty sharp and I would want him to know what rocks are, I would want him to know what mines are and I would also want him to be a darn good poker player. (chuckle) FO: Of course. I understand that even the best of the poker players can loose it sometimes. WH: Some of them pretty bad. Really, you know my job was trying to keep them from making a bad investment and
29

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 also to try to see that they made a good investment. Some of these uranium operators, they were just "gung ho" poker players. If somebody else wants that property, it must be pretty good, lets get it. That is not the way we looked at things.
FO: Well and surely for every person who made it playing that way, there were a 100 who lost their shirt.
WH: Oh yes, indeed. FO: That was common in that move to. WH: It was pretty rough. FO: It was very rough, well it was a turkey shoot, there
were only a few winners. WH: Well, you know that was the second big rush like
that, that I went through. I went through a similar rush in Mexico with fluorspar. FO: Fluorspar, really? WH: Yes, that was just as rough as the California Gold Rush. FO: When was that? WH: Well, that would have been in the early '50s, late '40s early '50s. So when I went to Utah why I was getting a second dose of this. FO: Of the fever, huh? WH: The fever, that is right. FO: Booms are of course a great interest to historians.
30

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 The history of the western United States is a history of boom and bust.
WH: I am afraid though that there has never been any real writer to record that uranium boom in Utah, the Colorado Plateau, Wyoming, and that area.
FO: There is a book out on it and it is lousy, it just doesn't get there. It is called "Uranium Fever" I think.
WH: Well, I don't know it but certainly no one has written the stories like those that came out of the Gold Rush?
FO: Oh no. WH: Those were tremendous authors. FO: Surely, and we don't have anyone yet for the uranium
thing at all. WH: I think that it is probably too late now. FO: I am not sure. Some of the people are still alive,
like Charles Steen and some of the more flamboyant characters. I understand Vernon Pick is no longer with us, but we do have some of the people still around. WH: Poor Charlie, he is a good guy. I admire Charlie in many ways. You know people that had been loyal to him, he was loyal to them and that is a very unusual attribute. When he got into politics in Utah and
31

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 became a senator, he got this bill through to buy liquor by the drink. One by one all of the good senators pulled away from him and that was more than Charlie could take.
FO: (chuckle) He did have his problems with the Utah legislature. He was very interesting. I was a lobbyist at the time. I was a public school teacher and when I met him at the legislature his disillusionment was profound.
WH: I never knew Charlie, I knew a lot of his friends. FO: Well, I didn't know him but I certainly met him and
talked to him several times. It is sad that his empire crumbled isn't it? WH: Yes it is. Another person whose empire crumbled, I can't even get a name to him right now. He went out to that, I guess it was Lisbon Valley Area and he realized that there was a tremendous fault in there. He stepped across the fault and denounced those claims and they sank a shaft and they found the extension of these ore bodies. He became very wealthy and he began to play with people with money. He was the one that brought ice hockey to Salt Lake. I am afraid he was playing with the Mafia because, I think, he jumped out of a hotel window and I think that he may have been forced out.
32

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2

LH: Do you remember that?

FO: Yeah, I remember that. I can't put the--! even have

his face in my mind but I can't think of a name. WH: Well, I can't think of a name right now. Maybe it was
Dan Meyers?

FO: Yeah, interesting. After the uranium zany period was over, what did you do for Asarco then?

WH: Well you know, when I was moved to Salt Lake I worked under Landwehr, but by this time he had retired. We had a very small operation there but Nevada looked to me just like Mexico. It was absolutely wide open and nobody around. So we looked at properties here and we

looked at properties there. We decided that Nevada was the place to put our money and we finally picked out a property that had a history of one continuous

failure after another. We were also interested,

very

much

interested in the area that has now become the great gold producing area in the Carlin region There was Keller's copper property in the south end of the zone. We knew all about Lynn Creek up at the northeast, and Boot Strap was off there

to the west. One of the last things that I did before I was released, I sent a lad out to head

just a little bit to the west of Lynn Creek and

33

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 every hundred paces to pick up a piece of float and put it in a sack. If the float changed characters, he was to change the sack and change the sample number. Well, on the way home, he ran his truck into a ditch. The company was reducing
operations as fast it could so h톏 was reduced
and shortly after that I was reduced. But we really had decided that the thing to do was to concentrate on Battle Mountain, which was the property with the history of failure that I mentioned and get it going, which we did. They are still mining copper there and Battle Mountain Gold is one of the great gold mining companies that Americans know. So that is my legacy. FO: Nevada has been an interesting area to look at in the last fifty years, from the doldrums of the depression really until--in Elko now it is an absolute "boomtown". WH: I can imagine. Well, there was nothing like that when we were working there. FO: I am sure there wasn't. (chuckle) WH: We had the whole place to ourselves. I think that we did a pretty good job of spotting the areas that we wanted.
34

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 FO: How much of the gold-WH: We got nothing of the gold. They gave away Battle
Mountain. FO: Why? WH: I won't get into that. FO: It was a company decision? WH: It was a company decision, yes. Turn off that thing
and I will tell you why. FO: Okay, I will turn it off in a little while and we
will talk about that over dinner. Tell me what happened within Asarco that it was--that it reached a period in its history and then suddenly started-instead of the explosion we saw earlier in the century it started to implode. WH: Well, what happened was that ... there were the Guggenheims and they started to get into the mining business. They were very shrewd people. Then there was a group of smelting companies that got together to, I 11 say to fight the Guggenheims. They went broke, belly up and the Guggenheims came in and rescued them. That is when the two groups formed American Smelting. Oh, I don't remember the names of the companies that were involved. In the El Paso area, it was Kansas city Smelting I believe. They put their properties into the group and that is where
35

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 Santa Eualia came from. The Guggenheims put some of their properties in. Well what were considered poor properties in those days have turned out to be the great bonanzas of my day. But the people from the smelting companies, and the Guggenheims, took turns running American Smelting and Refining Company. For a large number of years, maybe seventy years, this was very successful. But at this very period that we were talking about there were no longer any Guggenheims involved, there were no longer any of the other groups involved. There were members of the "clan" let's say but they didn't have the savvy that the old timers had. Now comes the play for power and this is never good. So that was really what was happening. Also at this time, it was the first time in the history of Asarco, I believe, that they had to go out and borrow money to pay their dividends. As far as I understand that was the case. So that was more or less what was happening, it was imploding. Oh, why can't I think of a name? Really, a real fine backer of mine.
FO: We will come to his name a little later, Bill. Bill tell me what your reaction was to moving to Utah?
WH: (He was A. A. Brown.) Well, the first thing I did was to go see one of the banks and ask where I should
36

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 purchase property. He told me that it doesn't matter where you purchase a property in Salt Lake, just so long as there is a place where you are able to take your children to the areas they want to go to. Because if you are not in such a situation you will tell them that you are sorry but you can't take them. The first time that happens they will accept it, the second time they may not accept it, and the third time they won't and you are in trouble. That is how we happened to purchase a property up on 9th Avenue.
FO: Were you pleased with it? WH: Oh yes, very much so. FO: Lovely neighborhood. LH: It was very nice, a very attractive house. We were
very happy there. FO: What about your working conditions, was it a dramatic
removal, a change from the way things operated in Mexico from the way they operated in Asarco in Utah? WH: Oh no, not at all. No, I just fit into it like an old shoe. FO: How many years did you work for Asarco in Utah? WH: Seven years. FO: From 1 54 톞ill '61? WH: That is right. FO: Did you resign?
37

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 WH: No, I didn't, I was resigned. FO: Oh, you were one of those that was laid off during
the consolidation. What did they call that? WH: I don't know. FO: Anyway, they reduced so many things. WH: I got caught in a cross fire there. I was never one
to keep my mouth shut. Maybe that was the reason that I got along so well with the politicians in Utah. I never called a spade a spade, I would call it a God damn shovel. (laughter) I am afraid that I was a little outspoken when I should have been a little more diplomatic, when I didn't have a cave to crawl under. I was always considered one of their more promising younger men. But they finally decided that I had been promising too much. FO: Now in 1961 you would have been about, oh fifty-two years old. As you cast around looking for something to do, tell me about that. WH: Well, I went out to the West Coast and I was looking for jobs in all the schools out there. I was looking for a job with one of the big oil and gas companies that was going into the mining operations pretty fairly. FO: Was this Exon? WH: No it was--I forget the name of the company. El Paso
38

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 Natural Gas. About that time this serious problem came up at the university and I was asked if I could solve it. So it was a lot better than selling my house and looking for a job out in the coast, so we stayed in Utah.
FO: What was the job? WH: Well, there was this little Utah Geological and
Mineralogical Survey which was under the aegis of the university. It was being run by a marvelous little gentlemen, a very sincere old man. He could tell you about every stone the daughters of the Utah pioneers had stepped on or sat on. But according to the legislature, the way the legislature looked at things, he couldn't tell you what to do with that stone. FO: What was his name? WH: Arthur Crawford. He had been getting a budget, I think of about $30 thousand a year. He felt that was a little too little and he asked for $50 thousand. The legislature being reasonable people took a hard look at it and gave him zero. Now this really scared the university. For the first time they realized that they had a responsibility here. It was really the Salt Lake Chapter of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers that came to the rescue
39

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2
here. Jack Erhorn was from U. s. Smelting, maybe you
knew Jack, he was on Dean Eardley's advisory committee. FO: This is the Armand Eardley? WH: Armand Eardley. A delegation from the A.I.M.E. went up to the governor and said, "Look, if we can find somebody that we consider a reasonable candidate, will you just give us $25 thousand a year for two years and see if we can get this thing in order?" So the governor agreed, that was Governor Clyde and that was when they came to me. I had just gotten crosswise with the powers that be, and asked if I would take the job. I guess the University was so worried that I might not take the job that they twisted my arm and made me a full professor and gave me two hats to wear. So I taught introductory courses and also took this job with the survey. It couldn't go any lower, it had to go out the window or go up. Well, it went up. FO: And it was your duty to sort of spearhead that up? WH: That is right. Really it was--there were people like Jack Erhorn, Norman Weiss, did you know Norman by any chance? FO: Yes. WH: Of course Norman and I had been very good friends at
40

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 Santa Barbara. They guided me and they gave me good advice. They told me how to sell things, which I had never known before. It was a new experience and once you convinced the legislature, the legislators, that you had something to sell that was for the benefit of the state, they would pull behind you. I worked under two governors, I worked under Governor Clyde and Governor Rampton. I am sure that both of them thought that they were looking at the south end of a horse going north when they first met me. But nobody could have pulled for me any better than those two governors, Governor Clyde especially. I told Armand Eardley that I wanted an advisory board and I wanted an advisory board that could walk into the governor's office and be respected. I wasn't interested in academicians unless they could do that. With Jack Erhorn, we put together such an advisory board. But I also wanted to keep the university informed. So I wanted to put one of the vice-presidents from the university on that board. Governor Clyde insisted on seeing every person that I wanted to put in the board. "Mr. Professor, that man is a political appointment, he can only hurt you, take him off." Clyde didn't care whether he was an academician or whether he was a member of the legislature or what, 41

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 as long as he was competent in the field of mining and geology. That was the kind of advisory board that we had. Both Clyde and Rampton--Clyde wrote the first bill that gave me a little bit of money.
FO: Is that right? WH: Yes. FO: How did you get along with Rampton? WH: Well, as I say it was pretty rough at first but
nobody could have pulled behind me any better, any finer. I never have worked for a finer person than Cal Rampton. Well, Rampton came in at a very difficult time and didn't have his feet on the ground yet. There was a period when there was a scam going
on that was being orchestrated by members of the u.s. Congress and members of the u.s. Senate, some very
powerful people. They decided that they would make their play in Utah. You had to be awful careful, awfully careful. Finally Rampton got his feet on the ground. No, my main objective was to make sure that the people I worked for had the background, knew what was going on before it hit them. FO: Who were your most valuable members of that advisory committee? WH: That would be very hard to say, very hard to say. FO: Was it a big committee?
42

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 WH: Very small committee, probably about five men. FO: But all of them were the kind who could speak to
governors? WH: That is right. FO: Now, how long were you in that job? WH: Thirteen years. FO: Now you started out with funding for the Utah
Geological and Mineralogical Survey of $25 thousand? WH: That is right. FO: What was the budget when you left? WH: Over $500 thousand and almost all of it was hard
state money, there was very little federal money. It was money that came from the state legislature. I wanted a very small staff, including my editor, my office manager, and my secretary. I doubt if I had ten people on the staff. FO: Tell me about your staff members, who were the key members of that staff? WH: Well, there Helmut Doelling whom I inherited. He was working in the coal area. There was Howard Ritzma who was working in the field of petroleum and tar sands, and Bruce Kaliser who was working in the field of engineering geology and Jim Whelan, on the faculty of the School of Mines, who taught seniors and graduate students how to observe and record. He became our
43

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 specialist on Great Salt Lake and was my all around troubleshooter. It was really a very--they were all very competent. I said, "Look, this is your job, go do it." And they did. Moreover if it hadn't been for the kids that I had working for me that were giving me their five cents worth of time, these Mormon youngsters, I couldn't have done it, they were just terrific. I treated them the way Asarco treated me in Mexico and they responded terrifically. Now, I don't know, I think they must have a staff of over sixty, I can't understand anything like that, an explosion.
FO: Well mineral production isn't up that much, is it? WH: No, it certainly is not. FO: A lot of state taxes come from those minerals. WH: That's right. FO: Is it true that those state interests were not well
guarded at the time that you took over, in terms of measuring. WH: The state lands, nobody knew anything about the state lands. That is where we made our play. What is there on these state lands that can attract people and that is what we went after. FO: From those of us who look at Utah history that is what we see as important in your period. It was that there was a greater definition of what the state's
44

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 interests were.
WH: Could be. FO: Or should be. Well, were is probably the wrong word,
I will agree with you. Because they didn't know beans about what was going on in some of the areas. WH: They didn't know anything about it. FO: How in the name of God, could a state, drawing that much money, go that long without a "watch dog" of some kind? WH: That is what the legislature wanted to know. FO: It is a damn good question. (chuckle) Then they were going to not fund it. WH: They were going to eliminate it. That is what happens when you are given zero--they were going to eliminate it, it wasn't what they expected it to be. FO: Well, in all fairness, in Crawford's tenure, nothing happened. WH: Well, when Crawford started out, he was I guess a petrographer and he did a lot of work on a lot of ores. But then he never had a staff that could carry on for him. He had no advisory board that could guide him: his advisory board consisted of old timers that were political appointees you might say. They were academicians and most of them weren't around. The old gentleman just went to sleep. He was told that he
45

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 would have to resign but would stay on, they weren't going to let him go. So I had him on my staff for several years until it was time for him to retire. That of course came out of my $25 thousand.
FO: Oh dear God. WH: It was really very interesting. FO: It was a very interesting procedure. In your own
career, do you think that your years in Utah were a valuable part of that career? WH: I learned an awful lot about politics. I learned that when the budget sessions are on there is always a reason for the way a bill moves. I learned that if you are going to get things done, you got to get to the members of the legislature long before the session. I doubt if I could work under the way that they have to work now, under the bureaucracy that they are in. I must admit that I was the one who pulled it out from under the university. I felt that at the time I left that the little organization was powerful enough to withstand the infighting that would go on up at the capital. But the university looked upon us as somebody who was drawing funds away from the university. FO: Now, when you left that job, Jim Fletcher was president. How did you get along with Fletcher?
46

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 WH: Yes and no. In some ways I got along very well and in
some ways not at all. It was very difficult to get a budget through that Fletcher didn't like. He felt that if it was more than the university should be asking for, or something like that, then it was almost impossible. I had to go around here or around there or someplace else to see that I eventually got it. That really is the reason why I pulled it out from under the university because of the competition for funds. One of the vice presidents, when you got a--maybe, I don't remember what I got. Maybe I got $75 thousand per year, one year and one of the vice presidents tells me that it made him ill to see that I had gotten a raise in my budget. It is that type of thing, you know. So it seemed to me that it was better to see that it went up to the capital. FO: Yes, and that move took place in your administration? WH: The end of my administration. I must admit that I was--well, I was really deeply gratified when I retired and the university made me an emeritus, despite all my arguments with them. I suppose that if you just live long enough, everybody becomes an emeritus. FO: No, that isn't true. There has to be a contribution before you can become one. It is not automatic at all
47

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 in that institution.
WH: Well, I was very pleased because I had lots of arguments.
FO: I don't know of anyone in that institution and I am still part of it that gets anything done that doesn't have to fight the battles. Utah is a poor state and sometimes poorly run. If you get the programs that work well, you have to fight for them. Obviously, you did a stupendous job with that.
WH: Well, they are getting a budget now of over a million dollars a year but lots of it is federal money. So, I don't know how much solid state money they have in there.
FO: People who live in Utah, Bill, sometimes complain about the society that they live in. Did you and your wife feel in any way negative?
WH: No, not at all. We have had marvelous Mormon friends. In fact, up in the avenues, it was rather a liberal area, maybe a little too liberal for the church hierarchy you might say.
FO: It still is. WH: So you know, we have had marvelous Mormon friends. LH: We have had Mormon friends throughout the city too,
Bill. WH: Oh yes, I mean up in the Avenues, we didn't get any
48

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 pressures. Oh, they would call on us and they would want to talk about the Bible. "What does this mean to you?" I would say, "I don't know what it means, but I know what it means to me."
FO: Well, I guess we get some pressure from the clerical side, no matter where we live.
WH: We had a friend who lived in Florida and the good Baptist ladies were putting the pressure on her, she was a Christian Scientist. These Baptist ladies wouldn't give up and finally they wanted to know about her husband. She said, "Well, he is a Druid." (laughter) Those Baptist ladies had never heard of a Druid. They asked, "What is a Druid?" She said, "They are much like the rest of us except that once a year on the night of a full moon he dances around that oak tree out there in the front yard naked. " Those good Baptist ladies never came back. (laughter) So you get this pressure everywhere.
FO: (laughing) I love that one. When you left the job, as the director, did you leave voluntarily?
WH: Oh yes, yes indeed. I figured that I had been there long enough and that it was time for somebody else to take over.
FO: You decided to retire. WH: I decided, I was sixty-five and I decided that it was
49

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 time for a younger man with different view points.
FO: Now, that would have been 1960-WH: '74. FO: 1974 of course. So therefore, you had worked for
nearly ten years under the Rampton administration. WH: Well-FO: He was elected in November of '64? WH: All right, I probably worked under him very closely
for nine years. Then I asked one of the men on his staff--I had discovered this about the Utah legislature, that it made no difference whether they were Democrat or Republican, as long as you kept your nose clean on the political side, as long as they thought what you were after was for the benefit of the state, you could get anything out of them. I asked this man on the staff, really a friend, why it was I got such tremendous bipartisan support from the legislature? He said, "It is because you are absolutely apolitical." In other words it was Governor Clyde's advice to keep politics out of it. FO: Which is very good advice. I don't think that you would have gotten any different advice from Rampton. WH: Well, I am sure that I wouldn't. After Rampton and I got to know each other, I couldn't have asked for better cooperation.
50

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 FO: Did you move immediately from Utah after you retired? WH: Yes, we came down here. FO: I see, back to Mexico. WH: Back to Mexico except when we went south of the
border, we went a long way south. FO: You surely have, this seems forever more, we are
almost to Panama. Oaxaca is really the last great city in the south before you reach Guatemala. WH: Well, yes that is true. It is a beautiful city and Chiapas does not have a great city like Oaxaca. FO: And you have enjoyed your years here? WH: Yeah, I don't have to stay. FO: That is right and you are doing so willingly. I must admit that in March when the weather is pretty lousy up in Salt Lake, this is certainly lovely looking off your patio into the flowers. WH: Well, I wish we had flowers but the water has been so scarce that I have given up a garden until the rains come. FO: Oh, that is only sixty days, isn't it? WH: Oh no, it will be in June. FO: Well thanks very much for the interview. I really appreciate your taking the time to talk to me down here. WH: Well I am afraid I haven't told you very much.
51

WILLIAM P. HEWITT #2 FO: Yes, you have.
