 THE FOLLOWING I S AN BY GREGG BROLIN AND COMMISSION COMPOUND, 1970.
INTERVIEW W I T H S . A . MAYER, CONDUCTED RICHARD GIBBS AT THE ATOMI C ENERGY GRAND JUNCTION COLORADO ON J ULY 21 ,
GB: Mr. Mayer, we'd like to know a little bit about yourself first, then about your experience with the A.E.C. and about the uranium business in general.
SM: I arrived and started to work for the Atomic Energy Commission July 24, 1954. And my first few months-- well, from May until August was what we called Circular Seven. That dealt with mining claims that were located on land that had been leased by the government to an entity, to a person or persons or compound, for oil and gas. But under the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the commission was allowed to lease these lands for the production and exploration of uranium under the oil and gas lease. Then all you had to do was locate a claim and apply for a uranium lease from the Atomic Energy Commission. In august 13, 1954 they passed Public Law 585 and made the Multiple Use Land Law where you could locate a mining claim on government land that had been leased for oil and gas rights. In other words, in the old days, when the government leased for oil and gas, that kep everybody else off. But when they passed the Public
Multiple Use Bill, we asked everybody to relinquish their applications for leases. Well, what I was doing

 S. A. MAYER #1
was checking those leases. Now about August of '54 I went into what we call the leasing branch of the Atomic Energy Commission. The Commission at that time guaranteed a fee to mills and increased the production of u3oa for military purposes. We had
leased these lands that had been withdrawn by the Atomic Energy Commission. Now these lands originally were part of what were mining claims that had been purchased by Union Mines Development Company, a company that was formulated by the government for what we call the Manhatten Project. The Union Mines Corporation purchased these claims from different operators and different persons. The Slick Rock area, for example, where the biggest percentage of them were owned by North Continent Mines, the Samuel Hinsall (?) operation, Utilities Magnum out of-- that's way before your time--out of Chicago. (Don't mine these asides coming in once in a while.) All right. At that time in 1954 we had made forty-eight leases. Now my particular job was the inspection of all these leases that the mine operated in a safe manner and that all of the uranium ore that was possible to be extracted was extracted. Then part of my time was spent in what is now a very controversial subject with everybody, rado and rado-daughter
2

 S. A. MAYER #1
products. At that time the Atomic Energy Commission
inspected their own mines. We measured the radon- daughter products. And we informed an operator that if his mine, his area was over one working level, which is the present regulation, that we would be forced to cancel his lease. That was on our own leased property. Then as the mines were operated in the state of Colorado, most of them, and in Utah, the operators in Utah and Colorado made it their jurisdiction, and not the jurisdictionof the Atomic Energy Commission, to examine and make the inspection of the mine. So from then on, we inspected them only for our own use. That brings me up to 1965. I'm still in the mining division. The mining division was the only place I worked in the Atomic Energy Commission. In 1965, I joined the production and evaluation division, and was on that for about three months. Then we went into what we called the Stretch Out Program. I was in charge of the allocation system as developed by the commission in allocating the amount of ore that could be produced from any mining claim or group of claims. Then in '62--wait a minute, that was '65--'61 it was when I went to allocations. It was 1 65 when I came to the evaluation division of the production branch. And my particular position--well,
3

 S. A. MAYER #1
I wear two caps. At the present time I'm the evaluation engineer for the Wyoming, North and South Dakota, and the Northwest. In other words, I evaluate properties that come up with a forecast of production and costs. And the other capt that I wear--take this with a grain of salt because I'm the guy that's talking. In the underground uranium mines with respect to radon and radon-daughter products, I claim to be the expert. That's why I suggest you take it
RG: SM: RG:
SM:
with a grain of salt.
Mr. Mayer, when did the A.E.C. first start--
Start leasing?
No, start dealing with the effects of radiation? When did it first come to--
Know that we had effects? Let's put it this way, the Bureau of Public Health and the Bureau of Mines started about in '52. Public Health was making examination in '53, '54, so following '54, miners in their different--is that the answer? Is that what you're looking for?
Uh huh. When did they make up these regulations about the mines? Who was in charge of this? Did the Bureau of Mines decide on these regulations or did the A.E.C.?
RG:
SM: The A.E.C. is not a regulatory agency, sir. Never has
4

 S. A. MAYER #1
been with the exception--well, let's put it this way. The raw materials branch of the A. E. C. , our branch here has never been a regulatory agency. We set up
arbitrarily, as I stated here, in our own minds what the working level was back in '54. At Public Health nobody came up with anything until, what, when the Department of Labor first put a stringent regulation on the basis of the Walsh-Healy Act. The only regulations that your states had--the U.S. Bureau of Mines had no jurisdiction. After we quit examining the mines, we took it upon ourselves to ask the Bureau of Mines to examine our mines and report. They examined our mines, they leased mines for safety and radon. But the only regulations was our own on our own mines. Then when the states took over, which was when? Hmm, '58, '59, 60, somewhere in there. The states took over and they came up with what you would call probability of .one working level. They would close--well, they did come down to one working leve because their first regulation was that for anything over ten working levels, they would close down the area, make you cease work; in other words, they gave a cease-work order. Then they came down to five, and then they came down to two. Now the states of Utah and Colorado right now work under the cease-working
5

 S. A. MAYER #1
order of two working levels. Anything between one working level and two working levels is to improve ventilation and try to obtain one working level or less. The state of New Mexico is one working level, 1.75 working levels for a cease-work order. And anything between one working level and 1.75 working
level, they are asked to improve their ventilation
and reduce their working level to one or less.
RG: What is meant by a working level?
SM: Okay. The working level is defined as, "One hundred
curies of radon-222 per liter of air at equilibrium with its daughters; the decay of the daughter to plutonium 214 will release 1.3 time ten to the fifth million (?) electron volts of alpha energy." Okay, there it is. There's my prize scale. "Any combination of daughters which contain this amount of potential alpha energy per liter of air is a working level. The working level hours are obtained by multiplying the hours of a particular--" (I'm just quoting this from
my paper.)
RG: You wouldn't happen to have any copies of that, would
you?
SM: I don't know. I might just have one. How about this?
This is what I read from, "The Uranium Workshop". r don't have one right here, but I can get you one.
6

 S. A. MAYER #1
RG: Okay, that would be fine. What are the effects of the
radiation and how long does it take to be harmful?
How long do you have to be exposed?
SM: Now wait a minute. Let's get two things. Now when you
talk about radiation--let's put it this way. Uranium ore is alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Alpha rays as a radiation are so weak that they don't bother you. Now if you are talking about the effect of the daughter products which are the products of the alpha rays, that to me is not radiation because that is the effects of the daughter products. The radiation is beta and gamma rays and have similar effects like X
rays.
RG: Then the radon daughters are more harmful than the
beta and gamma rays?
SM: No, we're talking about two different things. You're
talking about two different things. The X rays, when they--the alpha rays will not penetrate your skin. Now what happens here--let's go back to--let's go up to my little chart there. You have radon gas. All right, radon gas has a half life of 3.8 days, and it breaks down into radium A. Well, when it breaks down into radium A, then it is no longer a gas. It becomes an atom. The atom has no way of moving. From that, it breaks down into radium B which takes 3.1 minutes.
7

 S. A. MAYER #1
From radium B into radium C--and radium C primes--it takes twenty-nine minutes from radium A to radium C prime. Well, you see when radium C gets into radium c prime, it's 1.64 times times ten to the sixth power power second. So it's quick. And you call that radiation. The harmful effects is from the atom deposited in your lung. Just as alpha rays. But that atom start in there, and from there it goes from radium c prime, goes into lead-210, which has a half life of twenty-two years. Then this lead-210 gets into your marrow and your bones and your system and that's your trouble. Now concerning the other radiation in mining uranium ore, we have stated here that the only effects of radiation so far has been from high-grade uranium mines of 5 percent or more. That's burning your skin, or burning the tissue, or going in and effecting the organs and by your rays, almost the same as X rays, except they're not X rays, they're beta and gamma rays.
RG: Uh huh. Then there are very few mines of that high. SM: Yes, sir, very few. We call a high grade, an enriched mine, sir, thirty, forty, fifty hundredths of one percent. That is a rich mine. That is a good, high-
grade mine.
RG: Now then what are the effects of the radon daughters?
8

 S. A. MAYER #1
SM: All right. The radon daughters--let's put it this
way. According to our local pathologist, Dr. Gino Sakamano, who I say is the very best and has made more studies, for the simple reason that in the Colorado Plateau we have had more uranium miners than anyplace else. There seems to be an increased incidence of lung cancer from the uranium--from the people working the uranium mines. Well, Mr. Sakamano
is of the opinion that there is the (concomitantJ between cigarette smoking and working in the uranium mine. There have been about 162 deaths caused by lung cancer in this region that Dr. Sakamano has performed autopsies on, and there have only been two that have been nonsmokers. But if you go into the history of these two men that died of lung cancer, you will find a previous history of hard-rock mining; in other words, silicosis. They have had silicosis or "dusted 1ung" and with your radon daughter products, again the [concomitant] effects, and you've got lung cancer. Now, I'm not an M.D. or anything else, but that's the way it seems from Dr. Sakamano's records.
RG: Okay. Now the ventilation has cured this problem in the mines, correct?
SM: Well, let's put it this way. In the old days when I started mining, they didn't make too much of
9

 S. A. MAYER #1
ventilation. We just moved the compressed air around. But the problem is at present--well, let's go back to this. Where does radoD come from? Radon eminates from the ore, the surface of the ore, or from bumps or
cracks that have gathered there, and it is always there. And the only way of diluting it is by ventilation. The only known method at the present time is by putting enough air in so that the radon is diluted to such a proportion that the working level is down to acceptable limits. Is that the answer you're looking for, or does that answer your question?
RG: Uh huh. Yes. What type of equipment is used for this ventilation?
SM: Fans, electric or any kind of a power fan. One of your best known fans here is the Jeffrey (?) Muldone fan or any know fan depending on the size. Now in certain mines, say, in New Mexico, they have thirty- six inch vent holes. In other words a shaft. A raise
(?) that is, thirty-six to forty inches in diameter. And they will either have an exhaust fan on that exhausting fifty to ninety thousand cubic feet of air per minute. Then you have your shaft or other raises
(?) as your intake of pernicious air. Now like our new mine that's going over here in Lisbon Valley, the
10

 S. A. MAYER #1
Rio Algum, they're putting one shaft down which will be for hoisting ore and materials, and the other will be a ventilation and escape shaft, manual. One will strictly be for the ventilation to force air through to dilute the radon.
RG: How much does this type of equipment cost? Is it expensive?
SM: That and then your power that goes into it.
RG: Now many of the small mines have complained about the cost of the equipment and say that in many cases the cost of the equipment negates the profit they can make from the mines, they say that the fans and the
ventilation equipment really isn't necessary. Can
they operate without it under any circumstances?
SM: No, not under present rules and regulations, and they shouldn't be allowed to operate anyway with radon in the mine--well, unless it's diluted. Let's go to this. Even your low-grade uranium mines produce
radon, and they're just as bad as the high grade. But if it's not proper, let's go to this. It's not only your expense for equipment, but you will have to design your workings so that your air will circulate because you can't force it in there and not let it out. And then when it's diluted, you have to move it out. Now there is a certain relationship between the
11

 S. A. MAYER #1
barometric pressure and the rate elimination of radon. When your barometric pressure is low, your emination is greater than when your barometric pressure is high.
Okay, I think that answers about all my questions on
RG:
GB: SM: GB: SM: GB:
SM:
radon.
I have a couple on that.
Shoot.
When you use the fans--
Yes, sir.
--in the mines, how much cooler does it make it inside the mine?
Well, let's put it this way. I will give you this answer. Cooler? Not too much. What your average temperature in these underground mines, most of them is about sixty-five degrees, somewhere in there,
maybe cooler, what you're looking for is the effect. Now in Wyoming and in New Mexico where they have these big ventilators, during the winter when it gets cold and down to thirty degrees, they pu on pre- heaters. And in the Wyoming underground mines they circulate it through a pre-heater, circulate the air. In other words, they have warm air circulating and not cold air?
GB:
SM: Yeah. Now in the summertime and in the spring and 12

 S. A. MAYER #1
fall, why, it's just the air. Now what a lot of people--let's go to this. If you force a larger quantity or volume of air through a small orifice, you're going to get quite a wind effect. But if your openings are large enough, the wind is kind of strong. But so far some of these mines are not too bad as yet. Yes, there's a breeze, but not too uncomfortable.
GB: What were the miners' initial reactions to these safety regulations that were imposed on them? In other words, while they were operating their mines in Colorado and on A.E.C. leases, as you said, they had to conform to certain rules and regulations concerning the safety of the mine.
SM: Well, let's put it this way, the operators didn't say anything because that was the rules established by us, and they had to do it to continue their lease. Now the miner himself, "I can't feel it, I can't see it, I can't touch it, it don't hurt me!" That's the answer. Now I don't know whether this should be on the tape or nor, but there's a good story in Wyoming.
One of the miners says, "Will this effect my potency?" The other says, "No." He says, "Then I don't give a damn!" So there you are. No, you can't feel it, you can't see it, you can't--the only time
13

 S. A. MAYER #1
you can really see it, gentlemen, is when a man is wasting away and dying. Now one of my very best
friends smoked, drilled and smoked. Now that is one of the rules and regulations now, that you are not allowed to smoke underground in a uranium mine, not for explosive or danger of that, but number one, if you've got a cigarette in your mouth and you're smoking, whether you inhale or not, some of this smoke is going to be inhaled. And this alpha particle
.is going to attach to that piece of smoke or to that smoke, or dust, or moisture, or diesels fuel, and go into your lungs. That's the only method of transportation it has.
GB: When did the A.E.C. first start leasing?
SM: Our first lease was given--started operating May 17,
1949.
GB: And who was the lessee?
SM: Thomas Skidmore. Thomas Skidmore.
GB: And what claim was th~s?
SM: It was on the, uh, Sam and the King Number Two
claims.
GB: Did this prove to be a rich claim?
SM: Well, now what do you call a rich claim? Let¥s say
this, it wasn't a poor claim, but it produced a sizable amount of uranium.
14

 S. A. MAYER #1
RG: SM: RG: SM:
RG: SM:
RG:
SM: GB: SM:
GB:
SM:
GB: SM:
What grade of ore did it produce?
What grade?
Yeah. What percentage?
The percentage? It varied. At the end of the leasing program, it was producing around twenty hundredths. At the beginning of the program, it produced around thirty-hundredths ore.
Do you have any idea the volume of the claim?
Yeah, the claim is six hundred by fifteen hundred feet, or twenty acres.
No, I meant the volume of the ore from some of the claims.
No, I haven't got that. I don't know what that is. What determined who got the A.E.C. leases?
At the time it was mining capability or ability, his
financial ability to operate, character, that's about it.
Why did just the mere idea of an A.E.C. lease--well, why was this so attractive to an independent miner?
It wasn't attractive, sir. We almost had to beg them to take them at first.
The independent miners?
Oh yes. It only became attractive after a lease like this one became known, where this man made considerable money. When the leases were first coming
15

 S. A. MAYER #1
out, sir, we didn't have many applications.
GB: Why in '55 when they had the hearings on the A.E.C. leasings, why were there so many people? It seemed like they had an axe to grind.
SM: All right. Your lease had been in operating for six years, and the people had seen how renumerative the leases were and then they started complaining, "Why wasn't I given it?"
GB: SM: GB: SM: GB: SM:
Did the A.E.C. favor big business? No, sir. No, sir.
In comparison to the small miner? No, sir.
Or the independent miner?
No, sir. You can go through every lease. Now where the big companies got in, well, you can go down-- well, all right, who was Thomas Skidmore? One of the early uranium miners, right there. One of the original uranium miners. Now number three: William Houghton (?), he had nothing, just a uranium miner. Just anybody. J.B. Crawley, a uranium miner from the old days. All right, let's go to Henry Holland and lease number six. Now in that particular case, the commission through their contractor tried to obtain costs as to what it would cost to mine uranium ore.
And this property was operated by our contractor 16

 S. A. MAYER #1
under the foremanship of Mr. Holland. And he was just a mine foreman, a miner from Montana that came down here. And when the costs that were obtained by our contractor were out of reason, they gave the lease to Mr. Henry Holland who took it. Let's go on. Number seven was give to Nielson and Larson. Number eight, Arthur Canfield, a uranium miner. He was a mine
foreman for Sitton (?). The next one, Max W. Parkly, a butcher from Leadyille. Now here's one, La Sal Mining Company. The reason that was give to those people was--now here's one of the men that died of 1ung cancer that did not smoke. He was one of the main operators on this mine, this lease; a very competent miner was basically one of the operating contractors in performing your storage facilities in the Sandia Mountains for weapon storage and uranium storage in the Sandia Mountains, and then came up here and obtained this lease. Now, we gave Union Carbide, we gave Vanadium Corporation of America, we gave Climax leases on certain properties so that they would have a continued feed for their mill.
GB: In other words then, what this does is dispel all the allegations made by some of these miners?
SM: That's what I claim, and that's what everybody here claims.
17

 S. A. MAYER #1
GB: And that it is obvious that their claims were
unfounded then. SM: [Laughter]
GB: Why were some of these people so bitter? Why were some of these independent miners so bitter about the A.E.C.? They have nothing nice to say about the A.E.C.?
SM: All right. Number one, at one time--let's put it this way, if the A.E.C. exploration branch saw a favorable spot where they though there might be uranium, in trying to develop uranium reserves and uranium mines and to increase production of uranium, because up to 1956, the military were after us to produce more uranium, why, we would say, we would go---?--- those claims. We would ask you may we drill them? And we get your permission to drill them. All right. Then they came in and said, "I want my claims drilled over here." And the commission geologist might look at it and didn't thing it was worthwhile. Okay. So you felt that, "Look, look what the A.E.C.--they drilled your claims but they wouldn't drill mines. What's the difference?" And then go back to this. What they saw, why, gentlemen, was that some of these men made nice sums of money by this type of work. And after these leases had been give out, why, they wanted in on the
18

 S. A. MAYER #1
leases. That's why they were so vindic--so teed off at everybody. You see, we didn't make any more new leases--what was our last year?
That was in 1955. I know there were forty-nine granted and--
Forty-eight.
Forty-eight?
Yeah. Forty-eight and three contracts. Go on.
Well, the reason I said forty-nine is because the ---?--- paper has forty-nine--
Oh, all right.
But in the '55 hearings, they say there's fifty. So
GB:
SM:
GB: SM: GB:
SM: GB:
SM: GB: SM:
I'm not really sure. It's forty-eight?
Forty-eight and three contracts.
Forty-eight and three contracts.
Now whatá I call a contract, sir, was--well, wait a minute. In reality there was four contracts. And let's go back to another. All right, first ---?--- get side-tracked on another deal. The four contracts--back in the Union Mines Development in the
Manhatten Project, ---?--- I've forgotten their names now--Navajo Indian leases from two men, and we continued to hold those leases for private--gave most of it back to the Navajos so they could lease it out to anybody else. But we held on to twelve tracts of
19

 S. A. MAYER #1
land and gave a contract to Vanadium Corporation of America to mine. Now in other words, Vanadium Corporation of America had two contracts with us: one to mine the Indian lands which belonged to the Navajo Indians, and then to mine the leased lands up here. Now going back on this forty-eight. As an example, M.L. two, which was leased to Mineral Engineering-- now that could have been a big concern because in turn--the Ortmeyer Mining Company--ortmeyer was another person. I am going back on that smae one. The William A. Houghton lease became part of M.L. four, mineral lease number four. The J.B. Crawley lease was combined with the Canfield lease. So what I'm telling you, yes, there was forty-eight, but in reality there wasn't forty-eight because we're talking about the same lease and two different parties. As an example, the original Worchester lease was M.L. forty-eight, and Mister Worchester died. In order to be continued in his estate, it went in as M.L. forty-seven. It's the same lease but considered as forty-eight.
GB: Some of the buyers of the early fifties have said the A.E.C. didn't have a feel for the uranium industry. Do you have anything to say about this?
SM: Of course, you've got to take this with a grain of 20

 S. A. MAYER #1
salt. I'm talking to you. As an example, in all of these leases, in my own particular situation, even after about a year's experience here, I was always a s k e d , " W e l l , i n l o o k i n g a t t h e s e l e a s e s wh i c h direction shall I go now?" Now my contact was with all leases during that time, and I always though that we were through very highly of in regard to our
recommendations.
GB: John Schumacher refers to the uranium business as a
small business and deserving to be worked by independent miners. In those 1955 hearings, he obviously has an axe to grind. He seems angry that the United States Vanadium Corporation was give this large plot of land, this large deposit, and then, in turn they subcontracted eight or nine people.
SM: Right.
GB: He maintains that those eight or nine people should
have been give separate leases. That's why he calls it a small business. Do you have any reflections on that statement?
SM: Union Carbide at the present time now are operating considerable number of mines on what we call a company account. And going back to my original statement, the reason this land or this lease, or this contract was given to U.S. Vanadium was so that
21

 S. A. MAYER #1
they would have enough ore for feed to supply their m ills. L et's go back to Mr. Schumacher's. I'm sorry to say I know him personally. He's a friend of mine. He has his own personal axe to grind, but he has no complaints of how uranium has treated him. Have you asked him where his background has been, where he's worked, and how he got into the uranium industry?
We have an interview with him next week.
You do? All right, you find out from him then.
This was what we have found in the test law in 1955. Yeah, right.
How did he start?
No, you ask him! He's a graduate geologist. You ask him who he was working for when he came here. That should be off the record.
As far as leases were concerned, did the Grand Junction office ever send recommendations to Washington as to whom these leases should be given? Did Washington ever have a hand in who these leases were given to?
No, no. It was a mining committee composed of the directors of different branches here and recommendations was made by the mining division. A list of two or three or four or five names out of the
different applications was given and the mining 22
GB: SM: GB: SM: GB: SM:
GB:
SM:
a

 S. A. MAYER #1
committee investigated this from what was presented to them and the choice was made. But no, no instructions or otherwise from Washington ever came here. That I know because I'm way down on the totem pole.
GB: Do you know Dan Thornberg?
SM: Not too well, sir. He's been in to visit me here, and
that's it.
GB: Did he have any dealings with the A.E.C. at any time? SM: Why yes, yes. Dan Thornberg and his brothers were the
GB: SM:
GB:
ones that put up your Gunnison mill. He and Garth Thornberg were the people instrumental in putting up the mill in Gunnison. Number two, they were instrumental in putting up and operating the White King property in Lakeview, Oregon. And th e ir concentrates from those mills were sold to the Atomic Energy Commission here.
Is there anything else that they had done?
Well, then the A.E.C. sold out both properties, first to Murchisons and the Murchisons sold to Kerr-McGee. Then in later life he---?--- operated his property in Seven Mile Canyon and called it Corral Property.
In 1951 the Atomic Energy Commission seemed to take a new stand or seemed to re-evaluate its present ore-
buying policy. Do you have any idea why they took 23

 S. A. MAYER #1
this position, why they decided it was a time for a change?
SM: Well, I'm not too wel~ versed in this, but let's put it this way. In 1951 we were still not getting enough uranium as to what the military wanted, and something to be done to change the setup to make more incentives to the miners and to the people.
RG: Are you familiar with the Union Mines Development Corporation Ore Reserve Report of the mid-forties? Are you very familiar with the first circulars of the A.E.C., Circulars One, Two and Three?
SM: Well, I started Five, Six and Seven.
RG: What part did you play in Five? What were you doing
then?
SM: I was with the leasing branch. Well, as an
example in the leasing branch the liquidation settlement sheets that were give to our lessees our copies were given to us, and then our royalty paid us for it. That was mostly Circular Five.
RG: When you went into the other end after leasing--
SM: A llocation?
RG: Yes. Were you ever familiar with the Ore Reserves
after '51, any of their reports?
SM: I never really got into the Ore Reserve situation.
24

 S. A. MAYER #1
Now if---?--- Ore Reserves. I did the Ore Reserves on our leases, our operating leases. Then in '58-- well, after '58, '61, '62, '63, when our allocation program was in, I became acquainted with the Ore Reserve of practically all operating properties that
desired an allocation.
GB: I have no further questions.
RG: Neither do I. Thank you very much, Mr. Mayer. You've
been very helpful.
SM: Well, I hope this gives you some insight into it. Of
course, you're talking to the wrong person.
GB: Who should we talk to?
SM: Well, John Schumacher is one because I'm sold on this
side!
