MITCH HADDARD.
MH: Mr. Rawlings, as I told you in the pre-interview, what we basically seek to do is find out something about the legal aspects of the uranium mining
industry. The first thing I'd like you to do is tell
a little bit about yourself.
CR: Well, I'm not an expert in uranium mining. I'm an
attorney and have practiced law for over fifty years in Salt Lake City, Utah. I have been District Attorney, and otherwise engaged in the private practice of law. I've had some experience in uranium matters in regard to litigation, but my experience
has been rather limited in that particular specialty. MH: Could you tell me where you went to school, et
cetera?
CR: I graduated from the University of Utah College of
Law in 1919 and later got my J.D. degree at the same institution. I am a member of the Institutional Council of the University of Utah, which took the place of the Board of Regents. And I've been on that
board for about seven years.
MH: Now in the field of the legal aspects of the uranium
mining, what are the most pressing legal problems? What types of cases mostly come before attorneys in

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
regards to uranium mining?
CR:
The ones that I have had experience with pertained to anti-trust actions against companies who monopolized the product down in the Four Corners Area, in particular, the Union Carbide Corporation and the Vanadium Corporation of America. This action was commenced by a number of plaintiffs. The case also included many unnamed plaintiffs who were in the same class with the named plaintiffs which justified them to participate in any recovery made by the named plaintiffs. There were about four thousand miners in that area who were included in this lawsuit as unnamed plaintiffs as a class. After the lawsuit was concluded and the judgment was procured, a certain amount was allocated to those unnamed plaintiffs and distributed to them, even though they were not
members of the original suit--by name.
MH: Now this was done according to a legal process as a
result of a decision which was made in the case of Niseley, et al. versus Union Carbide Corporation, et al. Is this correct?
CR: Yes, there were three cases. That's one There were two other cases, as I recall, brought on the same type of cause of action.
of them. that were
MH: What were those other two cases, do you remember?

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS #1
CR: My partner, Brigham E. Roberts can give them to you.
Have you arranged an interview with him? MH: No, I haven't.
CR: He'll be back here at eleven o'clock.
MH: Okay.
CR: I'm wondering if it probably wouldn't be better if he
prepared the briefs and all that stuff, and worked on it with you. He could give much more detail than I could. Maybe you'd better interview him.
MH: Well, maybe you can help me with some of the background in this. In an anti-trust case involving uranium mining, is monopolization of the market the reason they bring these cases forth?
CR: Yes. In this case, Union Carbide and Vanadium Corporation of America were authorized to buy ore, vanadium, down in the Four Corners for the United State Government. They were authorized to pay a certain amount for uranium. Did I say--? No, it's
vanadium. MH: Right.
CR: They went down into this area and it was contended that they combined together and monopolized the market and paid the miners less than they should have received for the vanadium product than they had. As a result of that, the United States Government, a
3

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
number of years before this anti-trust action was filed, brought criminal action against both companies before the anti-trust case. That criminal action wasn't tried for a number of years and it tolled the civil statute of limitation. So the actions that we're discussing in which I was involved down in the Four Corners were filed within a year after the criminal action was disposed of which brought it
within the statute of limitation. My recollection is that the criminal action was dismissed by the federal government. I can't give you the reasons for it, but it was dismissed, and then these civil actions were brought after that within the statutory time.
MH: Was that when Mr. Alioto approached your firm for aid in the legal matters? Was it an extremely rich area in uranium?
CR: Well, there was considerable uranium down there; it was a fertile field. Mr. Joseph Alioto was the chief counsel in the case. In view of the fact that some of this territory in which the uranium was produced was in the state of Utah, the action was commenced here. This firm was associated with Mr. A lioto in processing these claims and in the lawsuits.
MH: Then you represented large blocks of people actually? CR: Well, my recollection is that about thirty-five or
4

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
more were named plaintiffs, and the rest of them in a class. Of course, we represented them in a class action which was part of the action where the named plaintiffs are involved.
MH: When you bring an anti-trust suit or a suit of this size again a company, is the main legal point which you're dealing with the fact of monopolization?
Well, it was brought under the federal law pertaining to anti-trust matters.
CR:
MH: CR: MH: CR:
MH:
CR:
MH:
Dealing with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act?
That's correct.
Were there also any Utah statutes involved?
No, there were no Utah statutes. This was brought entirely under the federal law or federal statues and tried in a federal court.
Doesn't the Utah State Codes also make provisions for this?
Yes, but these actions didn't fall under that case. They were tried under the federal statues.
During the period when this case was brought out, weren't there a lot of large companies involved? It wasn't just Union Carbide involved in this type of action, was it? There were many other companies as well?
CR: They were the main operators, and they not only had 5

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
mills available, but they were also the largest buyers and the largest operators down in the area at the time of the consideration, that's true.
Well, for example, there were cases brought against people like Continental Ore.
Continental Ore. One action brought against Continental, that's true, but my recollection is, in that case, the plaintiffs were not successful.
Right. Now this was in 1958 and 1959--correct--that this case was brought up?
I think so.
This is sort of right at the end of the boom period, more or less?
Substantially, yes.
Legally, how did this mass rush toward uranium, and the fever which the uranium created here in Utah, how did it affect the laws or the legal dealings you had to take as an attorney?
Well, I didn't have any experience in regard to uranium as far as legal matters were concerned except these anti-trust cases. I might say that in this
period, or prior to it, the government set up an agency for buying vanadium ores because after the experiments and discoveries of two German scientists, it developed that it contained uranium which was a
MH:
CR:
MH:
CR: MH:
CR: MH:
CR:

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
fissionable material which could be used in incendiary bombs. The Manhattan Project was set up to buy and process this uranium which was included in the vanadium ore itself. These two companies involved in these law suits, Vanadium Corporation of American and Union Carbide, did not reveal to the miners and the owners of small mills, first of all, the fact that it contained uranium which was much more valuable than vanadium, not did they reveal the price they were authorized to pay.
MH: So the miners didn't know.
CR: They didn't know about the uranium content and its
value.
MH: Is it true, that these large companies did offer a
guaranteed market?
CR: Well, they established a price between themselves,
these two big companies, and they either had to sell it to them at that price or there was really no substantial market for it.
MH: How did the federal government--the Metal Resource Agency is the one you were dealing with, right? Is this the one you're referring to, that was set up to make surveys and buy different things?
CR: Well, it could have been an arm of the Manhattan Project, which was really the project set up for the
7

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
development of the atomic bomb. It may have been the subsidiary to that project which was created by the government that made the contacts, yes.
MH: So there was not only private companies, but the government. Wasn't the government itself offering a certain price for vanadium?
CR: Only in the purchase of it through the Vanadium Corporation of America.
MH: Oh, I see.
CR: And Union Carbide, they were the agents. They were
the government agents.
MH: So these two companies then controlled the uranium
market?
CR: Substantially. That was the contention of the
lawsuit.
MH: What was the reaction of Union Carbide? I mean, were
they benevolent?
CR: No, they were not. They were not benevolent. They
were authorized to pay more than they did, and to pay the proper market value which they didn't do. Of course, they certainly weren't benevolent when they were charged by the United States Government with a criminal action. They weren't friendly at all, or benevolent, and they resisted the claims right to the very last. They appealed the cases in which we were
8

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
involved to the Tenth Circuit in Denver. However, they later settled them at a figure that was established between the counsel for the plaintiff and the counsel for the defendants.
MH: This figure was around five million dollars, wasn't it?
CR: The original judgment was around five million dollars, but was substantially less than that. Oh, maybe around three and a half million, something like that.
MH: You states that the case was tried in the Tenth Circuit Court in Denver?
CR: It was appealed in the Tenth Circuit Court. It was tried here in the district court for the district of Utah. Judge Ritter was the trial judge.
MH: The actual records of the case, if you were to look for a transcript of the case--?
CR: You can find a considerable number of the records over in the district court clerk's office here in Salt Lake City. But some of the briefs and matters of appeal and maybe the transcripts might be in Denver.
MH: They would be in Denver then?
CR: Yes, with the clerk there of the Tenth Circuit Court.
MH: When Union Carbide presented its case as one defendant, do you remember who the lawyers were for
9

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS #1 them.
CR: I don't remember who was attorney for the defendants. We were plaintiffs' counsel. There were or three law firms involved for the Uranium Corporation of America, the Vanadium Corporation of America, and Union Carbide. I recall one lawyer from Denver whose
name was Joseph Holland. MH: Holland?
CR: Holland, yes. But the records themselves will reveal that. Our files here, if we could look them up, would give the names of the defendants' lawyers.
MH: And these were corporate lawyers then for Union Carbide?
CR: Yes, of course, Union Carbide had its own counsel and Vanadium Corporation of America had its own counsel.
MH: What was their contention of defense?
CR: They contended that there was no monopolization down
there at all, and that there was no violation of any
of the provisions of the anti-trust law.
MH: Then the provision of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, which was basically violated, was the idea of price-
fixing, correct?
CR: Yes. Generally, price-fixing.
MH: Were there any others? Was the Clayton Act also brought in under this, or was it basically just the
10

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
Sherman Anti-Trust Act?
CR: Well, without checking it, I couldn't say.
MH: I have a general question since you've been in Utah law for so long. Has the tone of mining law itself
changes as a result of the uranium boom?
CR: Well, of course, when the boom was on, there was much
more activity. Many more cases involved, I assume, that like in all mining there was claim jumping and manners of infringements, and all that sort of thing. For a while there was a young fellow by the name of Mitch Melich, you may have heard of him, who is now Undersecretary to Secretary Hickel of the Department of the Interior. He was down in Moab, lived down there, which is the focal point as far as Utah is concerned, and he represented Charlie Steen who was the most successful vanadium miner down in that area. Steen made millions out of his claims. Of course, down there in that area, lawyers were pretty active in regard to claims pertaining to the product. And like the development of any other situation, when there is a boom, there is legal work to be done.
MH: Are many of these same layers still left in Moab or did most of them come up here?
CR: No, there is very little activity down there now in vanadium and there are not many lawyers down there
11

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
now. Mitch Melich left and two or three others also.
MH: So most of the lawyers who would have any knowledge at all of the mining law are up here in Salt Lake City then?
CR: Yes. One of them is Don Adams. You can look him up. He was formerly connected with the State of Utah. He was a very successful lawyer and he had a lot to do with procuring leases and handling claims for the miners down in that area. Of course, you can see that as soon as the boom started everybody wanted to file claims all around there, and that had to be done under the supervision of lawyers. So there was considerable activity on the matter of filing claims, drafting leases, and controversies that arose through either overlapping of claims or matters of that kind.
MH: I noticed that your legislature passed the Multiple- Use Act. This is a large act in regards to uranium mining. Wasn't it originally though that the claims were to be for just uranium itself, correct? And that the dispute came over whether or not there were other minerals, or whether or not uranium was of metal interest?
CR: That came about when it developed that it had a uranium content which is very valuable to the government for making incendiary bombs and so forth.
12

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
MH:
CR: MH: CR:
MH:
CR:
MH: CR: MH: CR: MH:
So originally vanadium there first.
That's right.
And then uranium?
Vanadium came first; the uranium was part of vanadium. It was unknown for a while.
Right. This is your 235 and your 238--correct?--of fission materials? When the Multiple-Use Act was passed, did this change or make legal dealings a lot easier?
Well, as I say, I was only connected with these anti- trust suits and haven't been involved in any litigation or legal matters pertaining to vanadium or uranium since that time. So I can't answer that.
Who do you think would handle that?
Don Adams.
Donald T. Adams? Is this the same man?
Yes, he could give you a lot of information.
Now when the business boomed and the penny stocks and all this came into being, is this the same year as
your case was going on? Sometime between 1957 and 1959 was when the real boom was, correct? I mean, the money was really flowing?
CR: It may have been a little before that, but in that era.
MH: Now when stocks and everything came in as well, 13

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
didn't this add to the large companies' power even more?
CR: Well, there were a lot of carpetbagging and fly-by- night companies that came into existence, of course. Everyone, almost everyone, that was involved at all organized a company and sold penny stock. There was a lot or marketing, a lot of activity in all these stocks. In fact, it was at a point where nationally everybody was looking out here to see if they could get in on the bonanza which looked like this area had developed into, so far as these vanadium and uranium was concerned. So in view of the publicity incident to the developments down there and the operation of the stocks, there was a boom market for a while, and a lot of people made a lot of money on these stocks which later became valueless and worthless.
MH: As a result of a lot of these companies being termed fraudulent or being actually worthless, was there a lot of legal turmoil or action brought when this
occurred?
CR: Yes. Stockholders who had been defrauded, I think,
brought actions to see if they could recover something of their investment. But these was so much
promotion, promoters were very, promote these companies
very active. They'd
and make
14
false

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
representations. Lots of them didn't comply with the S.E.C. regulations, and there were considerable lawsuits arriving other than that on the basis of people being defrauded by false representation of the stock salesmen in these companies.
It more or less seems that it went up and up and up as far as conflicts and turmoil, and then it finally reached a peak with these anti-trust cases, correct? In my opinion, the sale of penny stocks did not bring on these anti-trust cases.
Was there an awful lot of notoriety about a case when it was being tried?
I can't say how much reaction came as a result of these two cases. I'm not exactly sure when these cases were actually tried in regard to whether it was the top of the boom. I don't recall but it was somewhere around that period of time.
But they were pretty big cases for this area then? Yes, they were very substantial cases for this area.
Was there quite a bit of public opinion in regards to
MH:
CR:
MH:
CR:
MH: CR: MH:
what should and shouldn't be done?
CR: No, not particularly. There were a lot of problems
involved, of course, when the suit was filed and we included a certain class. We had no idea as to who was entitled to come in under that class suit. So it
15

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
was necessary for us to advertise in the newspapers and indicate that a suit had been brought, and if any of them had been involved in the mining and dealing with Union Carbide or with Vanadium Corporation of America to present their claims so that we'd know
just what they were and include them in this lawsuit. In other words, the activity, as far as the lawsuit was concerned, and notices were published in newspapers and in the post offices regarding the commencement of this type of suit.
MH: Did you get a lot of response when you published this? Did you get a lot of people who were trying to jump on the bandwagon?
CR: Well, anyone who was vitally interested and had a claim. There were a few that had not right to be included in the lawsuit, most of them were able to prove by their records that they had sold to these two companies during that period.
MH: Then this more or less was a secondary action in this class suit, correct? The case was decided and then you had to--
CR: The damages were proved by the claims that had been submitted to us. But the suit that was started took considerable time beforeáwe got to trial and during that time we were able to marshal the evidence and
16

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
get most of the people who were entitled to recover or at least find out how much their claims were.
In regards to the evidence and the different types of things which you would bring into and anti-trust suit of this nature, was it mostly mining records of the way the people had been deprived?
Records that they had retained by selling vanadium to these companies. They kept an accurate records of the purchases. I'm speaking of these companies. And the miners, most of them, saved those records or purchase
MH:
CR:
MH:
CR:
MH:
records showing how much they had sold to these companies, and that was the main basis of proving their claim.
Were there any particular miners, singular or mining companies as independent mining groups, that were like your star witnesses?
Yes. There was one man in particular. His name sort of slips me, but in whose name the original suit was brought.
Niseley, you mean? It's close to it. You'd have to check the records to get the name. But he was the fellow that they all were acquainted with down in
that area. He was a very prominent man, and he was
the one that these people got in touch with. MH: Oh, Howard Balsley?
17

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
CR: Howard Balsley, yes. I think the lawsuit, one of the
MH:
CR:
MH:
CR:
MH:
main lawsuits was in his name against these two companies.
Yes, he was a buying agent, right? And people contacted him; he was a middle man.
Yes, that's right. Only he had records of his own, and was able to get other records of these claimant miners that helped build up the damaged to where they were.
Were there any particular mines? In that area, there are some very productive mines. Were there any particular miner you used to--?
No, there were some small mills that were involved here and there, but no particular mines owned by any of the large corporations.
I was wondering about the people that you would actually--you called several witnesses to the stand-- correct?--in the case, and Mr. Alioto questioned them as to--
CR: That's right.
MH: I'm wondering how many of these witnesses would be
around still? Probably several of them, right?
CR: Yes. The witnesses that were produced, some of them are getting a little older, but at the time the case was finally decided and it was determined how much
18

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
these fellows were entitled to, some of them had died, and we had to pay the money to their heirs. A lot of miners down there were past middle age, maybe around sixty when this happened, and I think it was ten years or more, maybe fifteen before the case got to issue. And they, you can well understand that a number of them had passed away. Of course, if you could get in touch with and get an interview with Alioto, he could give you this whole story.
MH: How much work did Max Bleacher do? Did he do quite a bit of work on the case?
CR: Well, some, but this was a big case and Alioto did more of the detail work, such as taking depositions, and getting the evidence regarding the claims, and the amount of them, and that sort of thing.
MH: He's just so hard to get a hold of. He's involved with this other case now.
CR: Yeah, you ought to get in touch with him though for an interview.
MH: You mentioned before that the miners often passed away. Is there quite a bit of concern over the working degrees of radiation of the uranium mines, especially when they go several miles into the
ground? Has there ever been quite a bit of concern over this?
19

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS #1
CR: There wasn't any concern at all that I know of during
the period of these lawsuits and with these purchases and so on. Uranium was hardly known. It wasn't until the German scientist developed the theory that this vanadium could be broken down into uranium, and that uses fissionable material, that any though was given to radiation or anything of that kind.
MH: Once it was proven that it was radioactive and everything else, then there was quite a bit of--?
CR: Well, that came out after these lawsuits were over. I was not familiar with the discussion about retroaction, radio vanadium, or radio uranium.
MH: I have a question as to the mills that these companies actually operated. Now V.C.A. and Union Carbide had, or they operated, almost all of the large mills in the area.
CR: Vanadium Corporation down at Monticello had a company which was built for them by the Defense Plant Corporation. It was more or less a pilot plant, and they had a lot of ore come through there. The town site was built down there with government funds, but they operated it.
MH: Now this was the--
CR: The Vanadium Corporation of America.
MH: There's a name for that mill, and I'm trying to
20

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
remember it. Wasn't it the Climax Mill, or something like that?
CR: No, I don't think so.
MH: I remember that it was one that was actually built
for them with federal government funds. And this was
the largest mill in the area, right?
CR: Yes, that's my recollection.
MH: They had several processes. Wasn't one of the reasons
they were able to procure lower prices was because
they said they used one process?
CR: Well, they developed a process down at Monticello,
but I don't know too much about the process
development.
MH: When you brought your case against them, was one of
their contentions that they had to buy at this low rate in order to pay from the process they had to use in refining uranium?
CR: They could have, but I don't recall that.
MH: It's curious, because it was in a class action of that size. And there was an awful lot of uranium per se, tonnage involved, correct? And then they really did fix the price? Was it just for a period of one or
two years, or was it over a longer period of time?
CR: Well, it was over quite a long period of time. You haven't read the pleadings have you, or any briefs in
21

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1 this case?
MH: I've read the appellate brief.
CR: Didn't they discuss the facts in there?
MH: They discussed the fact that the ruling was on the
grounds that the prices had been unjustly fixed or unjustly deemed and that these men were awarded damages or more or less retribution toward that.
CR: The difference between the fair market price which should have been established and what they got.
MH: Correct. I remember in the appellate brief--this is the only thing I read--that one side was contending that it was a monopoly or that unfair business practices and buying practices had taken place. The companies were saying that the market they offered
was one they felt was fair for that area, right? CR: That's right.
MH: So it was the secrecy then? Is this what you were trying to bring out at the trial?
CR: Well, of course, they kept to themselves, these big companies, the price that they were authorized to pay for the government.
MH: Well, weren't they required to bring out an annual report? Isn't every company more or less required, if they're active in a certain area, aren't they required to--?
22

 CAL VIN RA WLINGS # 1
CR:
MH:
CR:
MH:
Well, I assume they filed reports with the government. They were acting as their purchasing agent.
Right. So then did they also have to falsify these reports to the government in order to keep the prices down?
I don't know just how they handled that with the government.
It would be kind of an interesting point. One thing I do remember though, now that you brought up the appellate's brief, is that it was brought out that the reason that so many people were able to be involved or to receive damages, was the fact that it was deemed a prime industry, or a prime resource. When vanadium was deemed as having fissionable material in it, it then became a prime resource, correct?
When it became publicized later. Then, of course, people tried to reactivate their small mines and became much more active in mining it because you see vanadium had sort of drifted to the point where it wasn't too valuable. And when they found out, these miners, that it contained uranium, and then there was a market for it, the government and other were interested in buying uranium because it was very
CR:
23

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
valuable to the government.
MH: Well, even before that, though, when vanadium was in vogue, or when vanadium was in use, it was in use as a hardening agent in steel, correct?
CR: That's right. It was very important in making steel. MH: So it was in this area then that the companies were able to sort of have a double stranglehold on the
industry, right?
CR: I suppose so. And then there were some small mills
down in that area that were operating under independent owners. We contended that they were put out of existence by the operation, the Vanadium Corporation of America and Union Carbide.
MH: Wasn't one of these mills in the Blanding area? CR: I think so.
MH: The Blanding Miners Association?
CR: I'm not sure if that's the name of it.
MH: But the small m ill--
CR: There's a transcript of the whole testimony and it
may be over at this court clerk's office or it may be in Denver. That would give you the whole history and background.
MH: This is the whole case? CR: This particular case, yes.
MH: Now when the case was settled, was the transcript put 24

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
under a sealed jurisdiction?
CR: No, no, the transcript is a public record.
MH: I was curious because somebody had tried earlier to see a copy of this transcript, and they were told they couldn't make a copy of it, or they could not microfilm it, or do any reproduction of the transcript at all. And if it is a public record, it
would seem funny that they wouldn't allow that.
CR: I'm surprised to hear that any citizen cannot or would be prevented from seeing it. I don't think
that's true. It's a public record. And I think it's accessible to anyone who desires to look into those records. I would suggest that on some of the things that you've asked me, that I've been very indefinite on, that you go over to the clerk's office and ask for those papers that we're not discussing and right from the docket themselves, you can gather a lot of information as to names, the number of named plaintiffs, and the class action, and the names of the men who were important in marshalling the evidence down in the area where the actions, or where the mining was done. And I think you could get a world of information just going over and checking the
records.
MH: It's forty-five hundred pages or something, isn't it?
25

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS #1
As far as my recollection.
CR: Yes. A lot of documents are filed there, and that'll give you the names of the attorneys on both sides, the actions that were taken, a lot of affidavits that were filed from people who were claimants setting forth facts that might be of interest regarding the mills and the interest they have in the mills. And maybe what happened as a result of this combine. But you could get a lot of information from just the court records themselves over here. Then, it's a rather voluminous record, but if you'd read the record of the transcript, you would then get all the background and the details much more accurately than I'm giving it to you because I've forgotten a lot about it. It's been quite some years since the case
was decided.
MH: I have kind of a question. After this case was
settled, this became more or less the precedent case
in regards to this action, correct?
CR: Yes. We established the law pretty clearly in that
case in regard to class actions. Until that time the class action, if it was known about, no one really pursued the theory that they could be brought in or could come in in a class without being named as a
plaintiff.
26

 CALVIN RAWLINGS #1
MH: So this is considered the precedent for class action? CR: Well, it's an early case, I'll say, on class actions. MH: This was really unusual for the period then when you
were able--
CR: Yes, it was. And of course, the defendant companies
raised the objectiong that there was no law that justified a class action and they resisted on the ground that they were not legally entitled to sustain such class action. But the courts held with us.
MH: Have there been any others, you know, since the trying of this case?
CR: Oh yes. I'm sure there have been a lot of others. I don't know whether they pertain particularly to this mineral, vanadium or uranium, but I've read where a number of class action have been brought.
MH: Are these things similar to the actions that were brought against the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, by small groups?
CR: Well, in a class action, you've got to have a common cause of action, you see.
MH: And the cause of action has to be determined first, correct?
CR: The cause of action has got to be set so that the title of these people that come in, and they've got to be a part of that class which is being benefited

by the circumstances surrounding the bringing of the class action. It's in the law pertaining to it.
So then the main point of this is that a fallacy has to be stated by the courts as existing?
It's got to be established that there is a cause of action applicable to the class.
Right. And then as soon as that cause of action has been established--?
Then the others automatically become a member of that class action, these unknown plaintiffs, if they desire to come in. For instance, I guess in pollution, mills who have smokestacks that emit gas, and that gas is detrimental to the farmers around in a certain category, why, that would be sort of a natural for a class action, you see.
MH: So it's a general thing. I'm curious as to whether the case more or less stopped the monopolies of the uranium industry?
CR: Well, it was drifting along toward the end of it too. But at that time I didn't know of any other companies that were getting together to monopolize the market down there.
MH: What about at the present? I keep hearing reference to what they call the "Shell Game"-the resurrecting of old patents and old claims. Since the large

companies, these large oil and mineral companies are going into the uranium industry, now is this a similar type of thing that might happen? Or as a result of this case, will they have to be definitely more concerned?
CR: Well, at that time when this activity on the part of these two big companies was involved, there was a need for this vanadium with uranium content and there was a great demand for the product. I don't know if that exists today as much as it did then. I don't think it does. Therefore, I don't think there would be as many companies that are formed and promotions by promoters to sell stock. People are a little gun shy about these penny stocks now, you know. There were thousands of these companies on the market during the boom. Just thousands of them. No, I haven't heard anything that would indicate that they're going back into this great promotional campaign to make a fast dollar off of penny stock.
MH: This is similar to over-the-counter type stock dealers, correct?
CR: Yes, these companies were not on the board. Most of them were not, but some of--these penny stock companies.
MH: When I brought up the modern companies, I wondered if 29

as a result of the decision which were handed down by the courts in your cases dealing with anti-trust and monopoly, it more or less cut off price-fixing to never occur again? Or would that be legally possible for it to happen again?
CR: Well, no, that wouldn't prevent people from going in and taking a chance on operating outside of the anti- trust laws, you know. Life anything else, when a crime is committed, that doesn't settle it. There are other who will get themselves involved and hope that they'll never be caught, you know.
MH: Is the uranium industry today still a consideration when you talk of the economy of Utah?
CR: I could tell you. But this Mr. Gibbons can give you an exact picture of what the industry is doing now and how much activity there is.
MH: What about Ray Holbrook? I¥ve also been given his name. He's a representative for a mining company as well, isn't he?
CR: Yes, and he would know. This is one of the larger mining companies here and he could give you a good picture of what that situation is so far as present activity.
MH: I'm curious as to people other than, say, attorneys. You know, other than dealing directly with an

attorney, who would have knowledge? Are there any particular men around the Salt Lake area or in the Moab-Monticello area that did bring about large claims and won or lost? Seems like a lot of fortunes were made on uranium.
Well, Steen is an example of that. You've heard of him?
CR:
MH: CR:
Charlie Steen, yes.
And now he's back down there indicating that he's
found some important deposits which will make him rich again. Oh, there were a lot of men that were interested in uranium and vanadium at the time this was on who were not lawyers. And I would think you might find some older member of the stock brokerage companies that could give you the history of what happened so far as the market was concerned.
In regards to the actual laws concerning claiming and different area there, these are covered under both Federal Codes as well as your state Codes 40-36 I think it is, isn't it? Has Utah done anything to change its codes regarding claiming or changing
MH:
mining codes?
CR: I couldn't tell you, but Senior could.
MH: I just wondered, because there is always reference to
these laws #250 and #589, or something like that. 31

 CAL VIN RAWLINGS # 1
Public Laws and I was wondering if these were Utah laws?
Any one of the specialists mining, 1ike Senior can give you all that information. I haven't been involved at all with mining law excepting during the time of this lawsuit, so I can't help you with the legal provisions of our state and federal government. So you primarily handle trust cases or civil actions, correct?
Yes. Largely in the anti-trust line.
There haven't been any other anti-trust or civil actions brought in related mineral fields since this

happened?
Well, there could have been, but I don't know about it.
As a final question, do you think the laws regarding the mining industry--when the boom came approximately, say, in 1954, when that was actually deemed as a desirable resource and then carrying on through all the way until the time when it actually ended, or the penny stocks fell and the need for uranium for use in the bomb sort of ceased, and they
had to switch over to what we have at present day-- you know, like at San Onofre, for peaceful uses for uranium. Do you think that the laws were antedated at

that time to handle the industry as it moved?
CR: I think that in view of the fact that vanadium or uranium wasn't known to the extent that there was that much activity on it, I don't think there were many laws controlling it. I don't know but after this development, of course, I assume that there had been
legislation passed to protect the public and also to protect the people who were interested in it and their operation in the state.
MH: What I was getting at, especially in the cases you represented, it seems like it was a perfect example of laissez-faire type economic politics; they just let them go their way for so long, and then somebody
made a statement that you can't put the--
CR: Well, I think these anti-trust cases brought some of these big operators up to the fact and to the knowledge that they had to operate within the present acts. I think maybe some other statutes were passed to protect the public, but I can't tell you what they are. I don't know about any. I would suggest you spend a little time in the clerk's office over here

answers that I can't remember off hand. Much I have given you is from memory and I am not clear on details regarding the anti-trust cases you have asked me about.
