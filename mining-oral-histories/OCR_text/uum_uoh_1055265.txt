 T H I S I S AN INTER VIEW WITH MR. JOHN C . LE BRET OF SPOKANE, WASHINGTON FOR THE URANIUM INDUSTRY ORAL HISTORY PROJECT BY NANCY HUNSAKER. THE INTERVIEW TOOK PLACE I N THE OFFICE OF THE MIDNITE MINES AT 6 0 1 GREATWESTERN BUILDING, SPOKANE, WASHINGTON ON AUGUST 13, 1970 AT 2:30 IN THE AFTERNOON. MR. LE BRET ALONG WITH H I S TWIN BROTHER MADE THE INITIAL URANIUM DISCOVERY IN THE SPOKANE AREA.
NH: First of all, could you tell me a little bit about yourself, where you were born and raised, and where you went to school?
JL: I was born at Wellpinit up on the reservation. I went to high school and then was doing various jobs. I went in the service, and after the service I had different jobs, but all the time I was prospecting. We got our interest in minerals from my father. I wasn't getting any place, so I decided to go to college with the idea of studying mineralogy and geology. I went to Gonzaga for a year and a half taking basic courses and went to Washington State College. I didn't graduate or anything, and decided to go to work for the Bureau of Public Roads. After a year with the government, they gave me a month's vacation with pay, so I spent that time prospecting. Jim was working in town and we decided to pool the money and buy one of those cheap geiger counters, fifty-dollar geiger counters and a mineral light for thirty dollars. I spent that full month prospecting, and over the years we'd do the rock type drilling on
the reservations for the prospectors in the

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1
surrounding area there, and it seemed to be better on the reservation than anywhere else. I drew a map of the rock types that we knew of. The last day of my vacation--well, it was the day before the last day, we decided to do one more evening of prospecting. We drew a line on the map right where we were going prospecting. It's very high there and there was still snow in some places and we weren't sure we could get
in there, but we drove as close as where we could. It was almost midnight when we got there, where we wanted to go, but on the way our little geiger counter picked up a lot of radioactivity, so we thought we'd check it on the way back, and we did. We checked with the light, and we even broke off a chunk and took the strike on the zone (?) and it just happened to be that it lined right up with the prospect hole way down the hill where Tom Hill had thought of digging gold over here. He had a place right close to his cabin. And so Jim and I, we took the sample to town the next day to check for uranium to see if it was positive, and it ran about three tenths, so we knew we had uranium absolutely. So Jim started prospecting down below right close to where
the mine is now and kept finding it here and there. About a month after that he sent me a postcard

telling me I'd better be getting home.
When was this, in the spring of--?
Golly, I don't know, uh--
--of '53 or '54?
First article, I don't know if it has a date on it or not.
I don't believe so.
That would have been in the spring of '54, I guess. Yeah, uh huh.
You made your discovery in the spring of 1 54, but you really couldn't do too much about it at that point, or you didn't do much about it at that point.
Well, we lined up property that we wanted and traced it in both directions as far we could with what equipment we had. And we had to lengthen it three miles--I mean a mile and a half; three-quarters of a mile on the strike, so it was as wide as it was long. We thought it was enough anyhow for one mine. We didn't try too hard to gather any other property, although we kept looking. We didn't have any funds, so we took others in to help us get lined up and get started. So we formed a partnership with the six of us.
Who was that with?
NH:
JL: That was with Clare Lincoln, Jack Lincoln, Ed

 JOHN
NH: JL:
C . LEBRET # 1
Lincoln, Tom Lincoln, Jim and myself.
Were the Lincolns you cousins? Your uncles?
Well, Ed, Clare, and Jack are cousins. Tom was going to school and studying law, and we thought that him being an attorney that he could help us with any problems we had that way. After we got rolling, though, we could afford to hire an attorney then. Then after you formed the corporation--
Yeah, we formed the corporation. We were still short
of funds. We needed $15,000 for the initial shipping costs and the costs of mining, and we started mining- -?---. We shipped a carload a day as far as we could go. And the government said that they couldn't continue such an operation; it was costing them too much money. We had to build our own mill.
Where did you ship the ore to?
Salt Lake. Redd Reynolds'(?) operation in Salt Lake. However, we spent another few months dickering with different companies. And then when---?--- came into the picture, he made contact with---?--- in---?---.
He called me up one day and asked it'd be all right to take a party out to the mine with us. I said sure. And he was a very intelligent man, I thought, because his thoughts just ---?---in every direction. And when I got back, I come to find out it was Dr. Mooney(?).
NH: JL:
NH: JL:

 JOHN C. LEBRET #1
I didn't even know who he was till I got back home and found out it was Dr. Mooney(?), the chief geologist for---?---. They showed interest. He was trying to work out a program that would fit the contract. So I spent time over that.
NH: What type of deal had the other companies offered you? Did they want to go partners in the operation of the mine, or did they want to buy you our completely?
JL: Oh, there were various offers. John Hokes(?) of Anaconda made us the first offer--thirty thousand dollars cash. We turned that down. By the next week a party offered us two hundred thousand dollars, and I could have done that; it sounded pretty good, but it wasn't really. I told them I wouldn't accept five million dollars. So we just kept the mine. But there were different types of agreements--partnership deals, this and that--but we wanted the company full ahead. ---?---
NH: When did the news start spreading that you did have a uranium strike?
JL: Well, there was one article before this--I don't remember--before any of these. It came out right away, but they thought it was a big hoax, so they treated it as such. People just wouldn't believe that
there was any uranium out there until we started 5

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1 shipping.
NH: Then what happened?
JL: Well, then everybody--the picture changed real
quickly. They had all kinds of people making offers and we spent a lot of time talking to various people. They were at our doors everyday all day long. We encouraged the people to keep looking; there must be another one around somewhere. And one of the boys found the Northwest--one of the boys from the reservation. He's passed away now. His name was Grants Peters (?) . Got the property, got a lease on it. He offered it to us for thirty thousand dollars and Newmont turned it down. I told him I thought it was pretty good, but he wasn't much interested in it. Then later he was given one million dollars for it. Same property. Somewhere or other, they were suing the government for five million dollars for not helping them build a mill. I don't know the whole story on it. And they were becoming a nuisance to us also. It took quite a lot to get them out of our hair and then later we dropped the property, and then--- ?--- picked it up.
NH: When did they pick it up?
JL: Oh, gosh, a couple of years ago. I think George was
probably closer to that. There is plenty of---?---

 JOHN
NH: JL: NH: JL:
NH: JL:
C . LEBRET # 1
They were talking about building a larger mill out there, a separate one on---?---; sure covering a lot of ground.
Where is that deposit located from your area?
I believe to the southwest.
Still on the reservation.
Yeah, still on the reservation. And no doubt there'll be others found. But I don't know, this nuclear thing is bringing an awful lot of work out there, probably
find others that we don't know about.
When you got your original lease, that was tribal.
Uh huh, yeah, and then when this ---?--- property went for bids, Newmont had found enough ore around the area to satisfy theirselves to go ahead and
fulfill their plans, but this whole body of ore which we couldn't do anything about without having a lease on it ---?---. It did show some radioactivity, not too much, but some--not compared to where we were running the ore from top of the ground. Do you have that article that I drew those lines on?
Yes, right here.
Well, we drilled a hole right over the edge over here showing that the ore just about had to continue here. So we put the property up for bid to the government, and the government didn't know how much
NH: JL:
7

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1
they should bid on it. I told them $125,000, so they bid $35,000. And some outfit from across the country- -I don't know who--bid $78,000. They outbid us, but they didn't know they had to have the cash right there. They had to have the cash ready, and they didn't have it right at hand, so it had to come up for bids again. So the next time it came up for bids, I think we bid a couple of hundred thousand or something like that--twice as much as I'd told them him the first time, and nobody else bid on it.
[chuckleJ But that was all right because he didn't need the money real bad anyway.
NH: You have to lease them now. Is that the main part that you're working on right now?
JL: Yeah, see, the top of the lease is way up here, top of the ridge way up there.
NH: The top is where you made your original discovery?
JL: Discovery, yeah. Jim came in and found some here and some up there. So far we haven't--oh golly, we've only mined about--! don't think we've mined a quarter of a mile. Well, maybe a little more. So it has
potential for years.
NH: Now, when you first started mining in this area, what
type of ore were you getting?
JL: Of course, close to the surface--oxidizers,
8

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1
pitchblende. I forget now over there, up here, mostly different oxidizers.
NH: Now you're mainly down in the pitchblende.
JL: Yeah, down in the pitchblende, mostly pitchblende.
NH:
JL: NH: JL:
Did you have any problems at first establishing a claim to your discovery?
Learning to mine or--?
Legally?
Yes, we had a lot of problems. In the past there was some law years ago that each reservation would make their own mineral laws, their own laws for mining. They didn't have any idea where to start it at all. So Clem Galbraith was working on the Indian council at that time, and he started to get people together to figure it out so that we could form laws to get working agreements for mining, and it took time to do that. But it all worked out fairly good. It was for the benefit of the whole tribe. That's what we wanted. At the time this happened the government was liquidating--liquidating is not the word--they were getting rid of the reservations here and there. And our reservation was one of the next on the list, and they figured to terminate it within five years from this time. Now Alec Sherrer(?) at that time was one of the head councilmen, so we were trying to get
9

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1
these mining laws together and he warned us about what was to happen in the next five years. I think that this mine saved our reservation from being terminated because it started getting new money in the treasury. We hired an attorney, and the next thing you know, we turned around and sued the government for six million dollars, and we got it too, the tribe did. But they were so downcast and so out at the time they were talking about termination, I'm affraid they would have terminated it.
NH: What were the grounds that the tribe sued the government on?
JL: Oh, taking land away from the Indians. See;á the Spokane Indians owned land almost up to the limits of th city of Spokane. They took it and pushed them back and told them that the Shimkin(?) Creek was their boundary, and they never had been able to argue with them because they were pretty much were people in trust. They couldn't have their own---?---. But they
were so down and out--they really were so down and out that, you know, in a sense that they couldn't come out with any independent thinking. They couldn't own their own land. They had a piece of land that was alotted to them; they didn't have to pay taxes on it. They could call it theirs, but if they wanted to do
10

 JOHN
C . LEBRET # 1
something with it, if they wanted to cut trees and sell the timber, they would have to go ask the government for permission. Or if they wanted to sell
it, it was almost impossible to sell without selling it to another Indian, or put it up for bids. At one time the land was selling for twenty-five cents an acre.
At twenty-five cents an acre!
At one time. [chuckle] ---?--- was twenty-five cents an acre.
The present boundaries were established when? Is it the Spokane River on the south?
The Spokane River on the south, Shimkin(?) River on the east, and then the parallel on the north, the fort-eighth or forty-ninth parallel on theá north.
And then it goes as far west as the Columbia? Forty-eigth parallel. Yeah, then it goes over to the Columbia.
Did you have any people that tried to make claims to your uranium finding?
No. There has--I don't know if you know about---?--- do you? Tom Hill's cabin was right down here. Right here was where we had to drill a hole in the hill, right here. So Jim and I went to talk to him one day, and he says, "Oh yeah, there's all kinds of gold up
NH: JL:
NH:
JL:

 JOHN C. LEBRET #1
there." He says, "Green gold, autunite," but he didn't have any samples. He gave them to somebody else. But he'd been up in the hills especially long by himself most of the time; he was sort of a hermit type person at that time. ---?--- ---?--- ---?------ ?--- ---?------?---agreement to give him stock, but he didn't trust our attorney--didn't trust us. Thought somebody was going to knock him over the head
for his money. But he was quite well taken care of. There was no friction there at all; none whatsoever any place.
NH: Was the stock market affected at all around in this area?
JL: Oh, by the uranium? Boy, I'11 say. That's a long story in itself. Our stock didn't move. One reason is that we ---?--- The fact is, we didn't sell too much; we couldn't sell too much. But the other stocks, penny stocks, supposedly--! was told-- supposedly they took two million dollars out of the city of Spokane on different prospects through the
stock exchange, penny stocks. Down at Daybreak they
found uranium shortly after we did. NH: Where's that?
JL: That's on Mount (?) Kent. They'd read an article á in the paper about it, I think somewhere it described
12

 JOHN C . LEBRET # 1
autunite as green crystals, and they got to thinking about a post hole they'd dug that had some green crystals in it. So they came back and sure enough it was pure autunite right on top of the ground just about. It's beautiful, right near the top of the ground. They had a large sample that weighed quite a bit--pure autunite. ---?--- Institute bought it for around eight thousand dollars or something. The mine kind of petered out. It was a small, high-grade find. They were offered thirty thousand dollars, and they took it. They had a high old time on it, I guess. Took a trip to Florida.
NH: Was there any other mines in the area that became producing mines to any great extent?
JL: No, outside of the Northwest there hasn't been any fabulous strikes.
NH: Then the Atomic Energy was the sole buyer of uranium through, what, '65?
JL: Yeah, and then they transferred it. They're trying to gradually transfer it over to private industry, but it works pretty slow. But it's being done.
NH: You had to shut the mill down, didn't you, in '65? What brought it back into operation?
JL: We got a contract with public utilities back in New Jersey or New Y ork--George knows.
13

 JOHN C. LEBRET #1
NH:
JL:
Was it really frantic around in here with people trying to find other uranium strikes at some time or just initially when you first started your operation? Oh, they were pretty busy there. They never think of Indians prospecting throughout the time we were milling this, but we were out every week looking at new properties. They'd look at new property, then they'd come running into us to check it out. But they covered a lot of the country.
But the Midnite Company is going further than just this particular mine?
Oh, yes.
Are you thinking of stepping out to different--
Oh, yes, different properties.
Besides uranium?
Oh, yes. Copper, nickel, silver in fact just yesterday, we got antimony. The day before yesterday, the fact is we got fifteen thousand pounds of antimony and lead-silver stacked up there.
NH:
JL: NH: JL: NH: JL:
Where's that going?
JL: I'm afraid it's going to Japan. It seems awful that
the United States government, they're short of antimony, we need it real bad right here, Japan's the only one who'll pay for it, give us the price for it, and they'll probably sell it right back to us.
NH:
14

 C . LEBRET # 1
[chuckle] That's about what'll happen. And then
nickel--nickel and platinum--I 've been working an awful lot all year---?--- Now, nickel and platinum, we're dependent almost completely on Russia for platinum and nickel. They can jack the price for them to just about anything they want to. We're just sitting back letting them do that to us. It's awful hard to find a good nickel mine, but, golly, we should at least look.
Rainier--either no bottom(?) or no grade. I've a claim sitting on uranium down in Nevada that's too low grade. Someday it might be of value. Of course they're learning a lot more in the industry every day, but it costs a lot to stake claims, do the assessment work and wait for that time to come. Look in here and I'11 show you the thing that ---?--- Here in the United States, those are the ones I'm prospecting for right now.
NH: Are most of your operations in the Northwest?
JL: Yes, well, we have mines, silver mines in Montana, Clancy (?) ; and we've been looking at some mercury
down by Yakima, Washington; and we have some interesting copper property down in the Snake River;
JOHN
Do you have any more uranium prospects?
NH:
JL: Not that was worth anything. We've looked around
15

 C . LEBRET # 1
and recently we've run into some nickel down there, need to take the time to look at. The nickel property over in---?--- County on another reservation--Norm- --?--- and myself and another partner are looking at about three sections of ground up here with nickel on
it, pretty good nickel. Someday we will have a nickel mine. They've a nickel mine in southern Oregon. I don't know how they're done. The only producer we've had.
try to help the search for nickel for their own good.
Minerals are the basis of the economy of our country. NH: They really are. What is the estimate of the reserves that we have in uranium? Have they drilled back far
enough?
JL: I can't say too much about that because, for one
thing, the Atomic Energy Commission--and I'm an officer of the company. But you can see in length, in the mine itself, what we have mined now, and we've got at least a mile to go. It seems like there's a little more at that end. You can make an estimate like that, but we have to drill out past--let's see, you'll have to ask George, but he can't give you the figures legally. We can give them to the Atomic
JOHN
In the country?
NH:
JL: Yes. They're short of nickel. The government should
16

 JOHN
NH:
C . LEBRET # 1
Energy Commission, and if I give one out, why, too many--what the Atomic Energy will accept is what they want to accept.
Thank you so much for telling us about your discovery and your operation. It's been very interesting. I've
really enjoyed it. This concludes the interview with John C. Le Bret.
