# Sample Workflows

As part of this project, the team experimented with different workflows for bulk downloading the PDFs from the University of Utah Digital Collections site. While there are undoubtably more efficient or elegant solutions, this is what worked for us at the time. We're including workflow details here in case it might be useful for anyone undertaking similar projects.
